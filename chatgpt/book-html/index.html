    <h3>Why this book exists, who it is for, and how to read it.</h3>
	
	<p>This book began with a simple frustration.</p>

    <p>Egyptian hieroglyphs are often presented as either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a mystical symbolic system filled with gods and metaphors, or</li>
      <li>a technical philological puzzle accessible only through specialized training.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both approaches capture something true — and both miss something essential.</p>

    <p>
      What is often lost is the possibility that Egyptian was neither primarily mythic nor merely symbolic,
      but deliberately designed: a language engineered to describe reality as it was experienced by a
      civilization that depended on water, land, cycles, labor, administration, and continuity.
    </p>

    <strong>Egypt as an Engineering Wonder.</strong>
    These reliefs are effectively visual sentences: repeatable, modular, constrained, and functional. They support the idea that Egyptian was engineered as a descriptive and administrative system, capable of encoding reality as experienced—measured water, counted grain, scheduled labor, and inherited order—rather than operating primarily as mythic symbolism.

    <p>This book is an attempt to recover that possibility.</p>

    <h3>Why This Book Was Written</h3>

    <p>Most introductions to Egyptian focus on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>how to transliterate glyphs,</li>
      <li>how to memorize sign lists,</li>
      <li>or how to map words into modern languages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Far fewer ask a more fundamental question:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        What kind of language did Egyptian need to be in order to support a civilization like Egypt?
      </p>
    </blockquote>

  <figcaption>
    <strong>Scribes of Ancient Egypt.</strong>
    A language that endured for over 4,000 years had to be robust, conservative, and systematically maintained. Egyptian achieved this not by constant reinvention, but through controlled transmission—and scribes were the central mechanism of that control. <BR />

Scribes did more than record words. They standardized forms, preserved canonical spellings, maintained sign inventories, and copied authoritative texts generation after generation. Through training, copying, and correction, they acted as a living continuity layer between past and present. This is why Old Kingdom formulations remain legible in New Kingdom monuments, and why periods of disruption (like Amarna) are followed by deliberate restorations.

    <p>
      A society that engineered irrigation systems, managed seasonal floods, surveyed land, tracked time,
      and administered resources at scale would require a language capable of:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>precision,</li>
      <li>reuse,</li>
      <li>compression,</li>
      <li>and long-term stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The central thesis of this book is that Egyptian met those requirements by functioning as a
      <em>process language</em> — one that describes actions unfolding within domains, rather than merely
      labeling objects or narrating events.

    <h3>Who This Book Is For</h3>

    <p>This book is written for several audiences at once:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Curious readers with no background in linguistics or Egyptology, who want a clear and intuitive
        explanation of how Egyptian works.
      </li>
      <li>
        Students and scholars of language, history, or cognitive science, who are open to structural models
        that complement traditional approaches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Systems thinkers — programmers, engineers, mathematicians — who recognize patterns of design,
        compression, and operator logic when they see them.
      </li>

    <h3>What This Book Is — and Is Not</h3>

    <p>This book does not attempt to replace:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>established grammatical descriptions,</li>
      <li>philological scholarship,</li>
      <li>or historical reconstruction.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Instead, it offers a complementary framework that explains why many features of Egyptian behave the way
      they do, and why long-standing puzzles persist under purely symbolic interpretations.
    </p>

    <p>The model presented here is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>explicit,</li>
      <li>testable,</li>

    <strong>Grounded Theory</strong>
    Grounded theory was founded by Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss as a method for generating theory directly from data rather than imposing theory in advance.  Applying grounded theory to Egyptian allows meaning, structure, and function to emerge from scribal practice itself rather than being imposed by modern linguistic categories.

    <h3>A Note on Method</h3>

    <p>Throughout this book, you will see an unusual emphasis on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>sound geometry,</li>
      <li>physical articulation,</li>
      <li>spatial orientation,</li>
      <li>and process diagrams.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is intentional.</p>

    <p>
      The approach taken here treats language not as a list of correspondences, but as a system of operations —
      closer in spirit to mathematics, music, or engineering than to lexicography.
    </p>

    <p>Readers are encouraged not merely to agree or disagree, but to try the model:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>decompose words,</li>
      <li>follow process chains,</li>
      <li>test predictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If the model works, it will work repeatedly.<br>
      If it fails, it will fail clearly.

    <h3>A grounded approach to understand "M"</h3>

    <p>
     Start with its earliest abstract form (Aa15) as a structural marker of edge, boundary, or directional change; trace how that core function is preserved, restricted, or expanded across historical registers; and only then interpret later iconic substitutions (such as the owl) as frequency-driven, embodied elaborations rather than original definitions.
    </p>

    <section class="subsection" id="em-overview-first">
      <h4>Understanding Egyptology</h4>
      <p>
        Egyptology's early momentum was dampened by the premature loss of its founders, ideological constraints in the early twentieth century, and the fragmentation of scholarship into national and philosophical camps—leaving many systemic questions about Egyptian language still underexplored.
      </p>
	  <p>
	  Seti I–era inscriptions demonstrate that Egyptian writing was not a passive record of speech or belief but a consciously managed system capable of restoration, standardization, and historical self-correction—challenging many later academic assumptions about linguistic evolution and symbolism.
	  </p>
    </section>

    <section class="subsection" id="em-overview-second">
      <h4>Understanding Motivation</h4>
      <p>
        Academics (Egyptologists, linguists, archaeologists) are primarily motivated by the pursuit of methodologically defensible knowledge about the ancient world. Their incentives are shaped by peer review, evidence-based argumentation, and continuity with established scholarly frameworks. For them, Egyptology is a cumulative discipline: interpretations must align with stratigraphy, securely dated inscriptions, comparative linguistics, and material culture. Stability and consensus matter because careers, teaching curricula, and institutional credibility depend on reproducibility and incremental refinement rather than radical reinterpretation. As a result, academics tend to favor standardized sign lists (e.g., Gardiner), conservative readings of phonetic values, and explanations that minimize disruption to existing models—sometimes at the cost of underexploring alternative semantic or diachronic possibilities.
      </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  Religious believers within the Judeo-Christian tradition are often motivated by Egyptology insofar as it intersects with biblical history, chronology, and theology. Egypt functions as a critical backdrop for narratives such as Exodus, Joseph, Moses, and early Israelite identity. For this audience, interest is frequently anchored in questions of historical corroboration: timelines, cultural contact, and whether archaeological evidence supports or challenges scriptural accounts. Their engagement is less about the internal mechanics of the hieroglyphic system and more about meaning, moral narrative, and continuity between sacred history and material evidence. Consequently, interpretations that illuminate human origins, language unity, or moral order can resonate strongly, while purely technical debates may feel secondary unless they bear on larger theological implications.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	  Fringe or alternative theorists (e.g., lost advanced civilizations, Atlanteans, ancient aliens) are typically motivated by a desire to challenge mainstream authority and propose hidden origins for human knowledge. Egyptology is attractive to them because of its monumental scale, symbolic density, and temporal depth, which invite speculation about technologies or intelligences beyond conventional explanations. Their focus often centers on anomalies—precision stonework, astronomical alignments, symbolic repetition—and they tend to interpret gaps or ambiguities in evidence as signs of suppression or lost knowledge rather than normal limits of preservation. While these theories are not supported by mainstream evidence, their motivational core is curiosity combined with distrust of institutional consensus and a preference for narratives that radically reframe human history.
	  </p>
    </section>
	
	
	
	<section class="subsection" id="em-overview-third">
      <h4>Understanding a Problem</h4>
        <h6>Academic inertia and risk-avoidance</h6>
<p>
Within academia, the strongest structural pressure is toward conservatism. Because careers, funding, and reputations depend on peer approval, scholars are incentivized to work within existing frameworks rather than challenge them at a foundational level. This can discourage serious exploration of alternative models (such as deep semantic or diachronic reinterpretations of signs) even when evidence warrants re-examination. As a result, anomalies may be normalized, reclassified, or ignored rather than investigated, leading to the preservation of consensus over the pursuit of deeper explanatory power.
      </p>
	  
        <h6>Theological framing and selective interest</h6>
<p>
For religiously motivated audiences, the risk lies in instrumentalizing evidence to support or refute preexisting beliefs. When Egyptology is approached primarily as a tool for validating scripture, interpretations that do not serve that goal may be downplayed, while those that appear supportive are amplified. This can narrow inquiry and reduce complex linguistic or archaeological questions to binary confirmation debates, which limits openness to findings that are historically meaningful but theologically ambiguous.
      </p>

        <h6>Sensationalism and distrust in fringe theories</h6>
<p>
Fringe perspectives often accelerate public interest, but they frequently do so by privileging narrative impact over evidentiary rigor. When extraordinary claims are advanced without proportional evidence, they provoke defensive reactions from scholars, reinforcing academic gatekeeping. This dynamic creates a feedback loop: mainstream scholars become more resistant to unconventional ideas, while alternative theorists interpret resistance as proof of suppression. The result is polarization rather than synthesis, where productive middle-ground hypotheses never receive fair evaluation.
      </p>
	  
<h6>The cumulative effect: fractured discourse</h6>
<p>
When motivations conflict, the field fragments into parallel conversations that rarely intersect. Academics talk to academics, believers to believers, and fringe theorists to their own audiences. Evidence is filtered through different standards of truth, and the same data can be used to support mutually exclusive conclusions. This fragmentation prevents the formation of shared questions, which are essential for cumulative knowledge. Without shared questions, there can be no shared progress.
      </p>
	  
    </section>
	
	
	<section class="subsection" id="em-overview-fourth">
      <h4>Overcoming the Problem</h4>
        
<p>
Grounded theory overcomes motivational conflict by enforcing a single ethical rule across all groups:</p>

<p>
No assumption—academic, theological, or speculative—is immune from challenge by the data.
</p>

<p>
By bracketing assumptions, allowing categories to emerge from actual usage, and continually testing interpretations against counterexamples, grounded theory establishes a shared methodological language in which disagreement becomes productive rather than polarizing. Put differently, meaningful progress in this study requires embracing both the passion and the skepticism brought by each of these groups, and channeling them through a common, evidence-driven framework.

      <p>From the image above, what value would one reasonably assign to M? Examining the inscription directly, basic set logic suggests that M corresponds to the trapezoidal element overlaid with the bird (element 2). This conclusion is reached without relying on prior Egyptological classifications or sign lists. Instead, the deduction proceeds directly from the observed data, treating the inscription as an unknown system and applying logic to recurring forms and their relationships. While it is possible that M could alternatively correspond to the scythe-like form (element 3)—a possibility that merits separate analysis—the present focus is on the simplest and most geometrically distinct artifact. Accordingly, the open trapezoidal form is selected as the initial candidate for examination before introducing additional complexity.

	  <h5>Value of the Budge resource for a Grounded Approach</h5>
	  
	  <p>E. A. Wallis Budge's An Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary (first published 1920) occupies a distinctive place in the history of Egyptology. It is both a reduction and a preservation: a distilled synthesis drawn from an enormous mass of prior lexical material—most notably the unpublished and semi-published compilations of Samuel Birch—while still retaining a breadth of raw, pre-standardized data that later reference works would streamline away.</p>

<figure class="figure-main">
  <img src="images/Budge-V1-pdfpage75-RHS-alphabet.png" alt="Budge borrows an alphabet">

  </figcaption>
</figure>


	<p>Budge's dictionary was produced after decades of accumulation at the British Museum, where Birch had assembled hundreds of thousands of lexical slips and sign references (often estimated in excess of 400,000 entries when variants, contexts, and cross-references are counted). Birch's work was expansive, descriptive, and intentionally inclusive: he recorded spellings, variants, and semantic guesses without enforcing a rigid classificatory system. Budge's task was to reduce this archival mass into a usable dictionary (~60,000 entries), organizing it alphabetically by transliteration, grouping meanings, and selecting representative spellings. In this sense, Budge's dictionary is a compression of Birch's corpus—far smaller in scale, but still rooted in the same empirical substrate.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>


	<p>The intellectual climate in which Budge worked also shaped the dictionary. Early 20th-century Egyptology operated within a Christian-dominated scholarly worldview, where biblical chronology, origins of language, and the relationship between Egypt and the Old Testament were persistent background concerns. This context influenced framing and commentary, particularly in introductions and comparative remarks. However, it is important to note that the dictionary entries themselves are largely descriptive rather than theological. Budge often refrains from enforcing a single semantic or phonetic interpretation, instead listing multiple meanings, spellings, and sign substitutions side by side.</p>

	<p>The owl glyph (Gardiner G17: 𓅓) is one of the most visually stable and archaeologically persistent signs in Egyptian writing, appearing from the earliest dynasties and naturally favoring high-frequency phonetic deployment. As a result of this durability and clarity, it has been conventionally designated as the letter “M” in Egyptology.</p>

      <p>
        This period represents a retrograde phase in Egyptian culture and language. The presence of elements that predate the owl’s conventional identification as “M” suggests that the turning-line sign (Aa15) may represent an earlier form of the consonant. Its more geometric, less pictorial, and more abstract character points to the preservation of an older orthographic layer, indicating a form of archaeological memory.

		<li>The edge/side sign (Gardiner Aa15) is the original and primary glyph for M in Egyptian, encoding a structural concept of edge, boundary, or turning.</li>
		<li>The falcon (G5) can function phonographically as A (per Budge), so early spellings such as MA reflect this foundational structure.</li>
		<li>The owl (G17) does not originally represent simple M, but rather a derived form, EM, an embodied or perceptual extension of M, visually motivated by the owl’s exceptional head-turning ability.</li>
		<li>Over time—especially under pressures of frequency, legibility, and scribal efficiency (notably during the Amarna period)—EM (owl) became dominant and was pedagogically collapsed into “m,” effectively displacing Aa15 from common use.</li>
		<li>The Seti I restoration period (~1290 BCE) represents a conscious retrograde moment in which older, pre-Amarna orthographic traditions were consulted and revived, explaining the reappearance of Aa15 without the owl.</li>
		<li>Thus, the modern identification of the owl as “the letter M” reflects late standardization and compression, not the original semantic or structural role of M in Egyptian writing.</li>

	<section class="subsection" id="em-examples-hypothesis">
      <h4>Workable Hypothesis</h4>
      <p>
        M appears to have originated as an abstract structural sign (Aa15), while EM developed as a later, embodied expansion represented by the owl. Over time, historical, ideological, and practical pressures compressed this distinction, resulting in the collapse of EM into M and obscuring the earlier differentiation.
      </p>
	  
	  <p>Based on this linguistic research, I propose that the primary root of M is the Aa15 sign, representing an underlying concept of turning or directional change. The owl glyph, rather than the falcon, appears to have been introduced as an expanded representation of this concept through the addition of a common vowel element, E. Under this interpretation, the owl encodes a bigram EM, while M preserves its more fundamental, abstract form. The high frequency of EM usage likely explains its prominence in Egyptological analysis. </p>
	  
	  <p>As this analysis proceeds, I posit that the primary roots of all sounds are analogous to M: each begins as a simple, abstract or geometric form associated with a core meaning and capable of combining with other primary sounds to form bigrams, trigrams, and higher-order units. These combinations are not visually continuous in the manner of the Chinese writing system; they do not arise by merely adding strokes. Rather, each combination constitutes a newly defined symbol that represents multiple primal sounds as a single unit.  </p>
	  
	  <p>Identifying primal sounds is not a simple task, but a workable hypothesis provides a basis for exploration. The goal of this effort is to map sound from symbol, effectively reverse-engineering the original purpose of the writing system itself. While it is possible to conjecture initial glyphs corresponding to primal sounds, such analysis must proceed cautiously, as a given glyph may in fact represent an n-gram of higher order (n = 2, 3, …) rather than a single elemental sound.</p>

    <h3>Sound Catalog</h3>
	
	<p>Because the exhaustive set of primal sounds is not known in advance, any attempt to identify them must proceed inductively rather than prescriptively. This requires reliance on objective, observable data—inscriptions, sign distributions, substitution patterns, frequency, and contextual restriction—rather than inherited classifications or assumed phonetic inventories. A grounded-theory approach provides the appropriate framework for this task: instead of beginning with a fixed list of sounds, it allows candidate primals to emerge from repeated patterns in the data, with hypotheses continually refined or discarded as new evidence is incorporated.</p>

<p>
Within this framework, the Egyptian language can be examined from an engineering mindset, treating the writing system as a functional mechanism designed to encode sound. Each glyph is evaluated not for its traditional label, but for what it demonstrably does: where it appears, what it replaces, how often it occurs, and under what constraints. By iteratively testing candidate primals against the full corpus—seeking both confirming patterns and counterexamples—this approach prioritizes explanatory power over tradition. In doing so, it aims to reconstruct the sound system encoded by the script in a disciplined, transparent way, grounded in data rather than authority.

        Egyptian is conventionally described as a consonantal writing system in which vowels are frequently omitted. Certain vowel qualities, commonly transcribed as A and I and U, are relatively well attested through comparative evidence, while the status of E and O remains less clearly defined. This does not imply that Egyptian lacked vowels, but rather that vowel realization was likely governed by contextual rules tied to consonantal patterns—rules that were not explicitly recorded and have largely been lost. Within this framework, the EM hypothesis is consistent with the nature of the script: what is commonly classified as a single consonant M may in fact reflect a highly frequent vowel–consonant bigram, EM, whose internal vowel was no longer distinguished in writing.

       Egyptian phonetics presents significant challenges. Although the sound conventionally labeled K functions as a single phonetic category in speech, it is represented in writing through multiple core implementations—most notably a distinction between K (including KH and KHA) and Q. From a mathematical and engineering perspective, a well-designed sound–symbol system would be expected to encode such a phonetic unit with a single, consistent key. The proliferation of distinct symbols associated with K therefore introduces ambiguity and obscures underlying structure. One can either accept this uncertainty as irreducible, or attempt to reduce the symbol set to a more meaningful and coherent mapping. The latter approach was effectively adopted by the academic community through Gardiner’s standardization. However, my grounded-theory hypothesis is that this decision warrants re-examination using foundational principles—particularly one-to-one mapping—to determine whether the observed multiplicity reflects true phonetic distinction or later orthographic expansion.

    <h3>Example Patterns</h3>
    <p>
      A comprehensive, exhaustive review of the full Budge corpus (~60,000 entries), and especially of Birch’s original lexical collections (~400,000 entries), is not currently feasible. In an ideal methodological setting, these materials would be fully digitized and back-indexed at the glyph level, enabling computational analysis to identify frequency distributions, co-occurrence patterns, substitutions, and emergent clusters across the corpus. Such an approach would support statistically driven inference and large-scale pattern detection. However, in the absence of a machine-readable, glyph-indexed dataset, this study is necessarily constrained to non-exhaustive analysis.</p>

<p>To address this limitation, the methodology adopts a grounded-theory sampling strategy. Rather than attempting total coverage, the analysis proceeds through theoretical sampling: selecting representative glyphs and sign groups based on recurrence, variability, and apparent structural significance, and iteratively refining categories as patterns emerge. Constant comparison across selected cases is used to test provisional interpretations, while negative or anomalous cases are actively sought to challenge and refine the developing model. This approach prioritizes explanatory coherence over completeness and allows meaningful structural insights to emerge despite data-scale constraints.

    <section class="subsection" id="sc-vowels-primal">
      <h4>Complexity from Simplicity</h4>
	<p>
	  In defining his sign list, Budge frequently records complex symbols as being pronounced through simpler component forms. From a grounded-theory perspective, this reflects an implicit recognition that complexity in the writing system emerges from combinations of more elementary units rather than from isolated, irreducible signs. This observation is not unique to the present analysis; it is already visible in the work of Birch and Budge, whose descriptive cataloging preserves evidence of how simpler forms recur within more complex constructions. Rather than imposing a fixed hierarchy, this approach allows structural relationships to emerge from usage, aligning with an inductive, data-driven methodology.

<p>
  Extending this analysis within a grounded-theory framework, it is reasonable to hypothesize that not all signs traditionally classified as "simple" are equally fundamental. Some of these ostensibly simple forms may in fact represent compressed combinations of more elementary units—that is, n-grams that have been consolidated into single symbols through repeated use. Grounded theory permits this inference to arise inductively from observed substitution patterns, frequency, and structural recurrence rather than from predefined categories. If complexity can emerge from the aggregation of simpler elements, then it follows logically that the writing system must also contain a small set of truly minimal root symbols, from which more complex phonetic and semantic constructions were derived to encode foundational sounds.

    <section class="subsection" id="sc-minimal-root-symbols">
      <h4>Minimal Root Symbols</h4>
      <p>
        The alphabet employed by Budge provides a useful starting point for identifying meaningful minimal root symbols. From a mathematical perspective, several of these forms are striking in their geometric simplicity: P appears as a small square, s as a linear stroke or line segment, one common form of K as a right triangle, and T as a semicircle. The existence of symbols representing a perfect circle—both with and without a central point—further supports the hypothesis that some phonetic signs may be grounded in basic geometric primitives. This raises the question of whether such shapes constitute the foundational frame of the system. Within this view, R appears as a closed loop that is not a perfect circle, M (Aa15) as a turning or incomplete loop, H as a box-like linear enclosure, and TH (th) as a more precise closed circuit with defined openings marked by circular elements. Taken together, these observations suggest a coherent geometric basis for identifying the most structurally simple root symbols and provide a strong anchor point for further analysis.

      <h4>Primary Objective Defined</h4>
      <p>The primary objective is therefore clear: to determine whether minimal root symbols can be identified within the system. Achieving this requires first identifying the minimal root sounds, since a one-to-one mapping between sound and symbol cannot be established without a well-defined phonetic basis. To support this effort, a sound wheel will be developed that organizes sounds according to their spatial proximity within the mouth and their manner of articulation as they are formed and transmitted.</p>

<p>Consistent with a grounded-theory approach, this analysis does not begin by adopting an existing phonetic framework as authoritative, though data from established frameworks are incorporated where useful. Instead, sounds are cataloged inductively and comprehensively, with the acknowledgment that some degree of research bias is unavoidable. As a native speaker of American English, the symbolic conventions employed will naturally be more familiar to that linguistic community. In addition, Spanish vowel symbols are used to represent vowel sounds, both because this aligns closely with Budge’s pronunciation conventions and because Spanish exhibits a more stable and consistent relationship between vowel symbols and pronunciation than English.</p>

	<p>The next step is to identify the core sounds, map them onto a sound wheel, and represent each sound using a consistent set of common symbols.

	<section class="section" id="sw-overview">
    <h3>Sound Physiology</h3>
    <p>
      Human speech is produced through the coordinated action of the respiratory system, the larynx, and the vocal tract. Air expelled from the lungs provides the energy source for sound. As this airflow passes upward through the trachea and reaches the larynx, it encounters the vocal folds, which can either vibrate or remain open. When the vocal folds vibrate, they generate voiced sounds; when they remain open, the airflow produces voiceless sounds shaped further along the vocal tract. This vibration does not yet create recognizable speech—it produces a raw acoustic signal that must be shaped into distinct sounds.
	  </p>

<p>
The shaping of this sound occurs in the vocal tract, which includes the pharynx, oral cavity, and nasal cavity. Movements of the tongue, lips, teeth, and alveolar ridge modify airflow by constricting, redirecting, or briefly stopping it. Different places of articulation—such as bilabial (both lips), dental (tongue against teeth), alveolar (tongue against the ridge behind the teeth), and velar (back of the tongue against the soft palate)—produce different classes of sounds. The manner of articulation (stops, fricatives, nasals, approximants) further distinguishes how the airflow is manipulated, whether it is fully blocked, partially constricted, or allowed to pass freely.
</p>

</figure>


<p>

Vowel sounds arise primarily from changes in the shape and resonance of the vocal tract, rather than from obstruction. By adjusting tongue height, tongue position (front to back), and lip rounding, the vocal tract acts as a resonant chamber that amplifies certain frequencies. This makes vowels inherently more continuous and sonorous than consonants. Together, these physiological processes form a finite but flexible system capable of generating the full range of human speech sounds, providing the biological foundation upon which all spoken languages—and their written representations—are built.

	<p>Identifying definitions for individual symbols is a nontrivial task. Ideally, one would query the corpus directly—for example, by retrieving all occurrences of a given glyph—to enable systematic comparison. In the absence of such tooling, this analysis proceeds using grounded-theory methods and the resources available. The process begins with open coding, in which large portions of the dictionary—approximately 60,000 entries—are surveyed to identify recurring phonetic markers, such as (th), without imposing predefined categories. Once candidate symbols are identified, axial coding is applied by examining their surrounding contexts, co-occurring signs, and usage patterns to establish relationships between form, function, and meaning. In cases where the dictionary groups multiple entries under the same symbol, these sections provide a concentrated dataset that supports stronger relational inference, allowing interpretive structure to emerge directly from the data rather than from ad-hoc discovery given the constraints.

      <p>
        Because sound is fundamentally driven by breath, the first consonant to introduce is H, which functions as a natural aspirated sound and may at times carry little or no lexical meaning. The sound sequence HUA can be used to represent a basic breathing cycle, with HU corresponding to exhalation and A(H) to inhalation.
      </p>
	  
	  <p>There are too many foundational sounds to introduce all at once, so we will begin with a small subset. Produce the G and K sounds and note where you feel the articulation occurring. Then observe their placement on the Sound Wheel. You will notice that G is positioned slightly above K, reflecting their close articulatory relationship.  </p>
	  
	  <p>Comparative articulation of neighboring sounds allows their relative locations to be perceived directly. The use of up/down or forward/back notation does not describe specific physiological mechanisms, such as exact tongue or tooth placement, but instead functions as a principal-component–like relational coordinate system, capturing the dominant dimensions along which sounds vary. These axes represent the primary components of articulatory difference, positioning each sound relative to others within the vocal tract rather than providing a literal anatomical description. </p>
	  
	  <p>In this framework, the vector extending from the center of the circle to each vowel—[A, E, U, O, ʔ]—represents the point of maximal articulation for that sound, with the radial lines forming a regular pentagram. These vectors define idealized targets rather than obligatory pronunciations. In practice, language speakers tend toward articulatory economy, so the realized pronunciation of a vowel often falls short of the vector’s full extent, resulting in a dampened articulation. This notion of vector-based placement, with natural truncation along the radial direction, applies broadly to both vowels and consonants; however, it is most clearly observed and most consistently applied in the articulation of core vowel sounds. </p>

	<p>Articulating every detail of the grounded process used to develop this Sound Wheel—particularly in a fully evolutionary narrative—is difficult. The model has been refined iteratively over the past three to five years, and in its current form it appears to satisfy the fundamental criteria of a heuristic principal-component analysis, capturing the dominant dimensions along which sounds vary and how the spatially correspond. </p>

    <h3>Sound string "MILK"</h3>
    <p>
      Using the Sound Wheel, sounds can be sequenced according to their articulatory proximity, with emphasis placed on pronunciation rather than spelling. As a practical exercise, pronounce the English word “milk” as “mee-lk,” then repeat the word as you would in everyday speech. While doing so, observe your mouth, lips, and jaw in a mirror. The first articulation produces a more open and expressive facial gesture, whereas the habitual pronunciation is noticeably dampened. This contrast illustrates how sounds naturally compress and blend in ordinary speech—a process I refer to as lazy loading—and highlights the role of the Sound Wheel in making such articulatory behavior visually and conceptually explicit.

	Observe the progression of sounds along the Sound Wheel: M–I–L–K. Within the principal-component space, a sequence of sounds generates a distinctive signature composed of explicit, directed vector movements. This suggests that a foundational sound framework may itself carry semantic structure, contributing to meaning at a level prior to vocabulary. Reconsider, in this light, the Egyptian (th) sound and its placement within the vector space—centered along the vertical midline and extending outward along the horizontal axis. The question then arises: is this alignment merely coincidental, or does it reflect an intentionally engineered relationship between sound, articulation, and meaning in the Egyptian system?

    <h3>Sound string "M(IE)LK"</h3>
    <p>
	The vector space shifts when a vowel blend is introduced, a natural consequence of the lazy-loading phenomenon. In the sequence M–I–L, the articulatory distance to I is maximal, creating pressure to shorten the transition toward L. Speakers achieve this by blending I with E (or even with ʔ), producing a dampened I sound of the kind commonly heard in English. This behavior serves as a useful validation of the Sound Wheel’s design: it accommodates both precise, fully articulated pronunciations and more compressed, economical ones. If needed, additional core sounds can be incorporated, and blends of vowels and consonants can be consistently mapped within the same vector space, demonstrating the model’s spatial robustness.

	<p>Now consider the word milk, an English term that can be mapped onto the universal Sound Wheel. This raises the question of whether the word carries meaning that emerges from its constituent root sounds. To explore this possibility, the primary sounds represented on the wheel would first need to be assigned provisional core meanings. These meanings could then be evaluated by comparing their fundamental usage in Egyptian and across other languages to assess consistency and validity. With the availability of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, it is now possible to assist this process by supplying foundational prompts and using the responses as exploratory data points within a grounded-theory framework.</p>
	
	<p>The short answer is that milk does appear to carry meaning at the level of its constituent sounds, though different vowel realizations suggest different nuances. A pronunciation closer to M(IE)LK aligns with the image of a healthy, breastfeeding infant—centered, balanced, and sustained. By contrast, M(Iʔ)LK evokes the child’s early learning process, particularly the emerging distinction between airflow and the swallowing of liquid, a contrast grounded in the foundational role of the glottal stop ʔ. </p>
	
	<p>Said differently, In functional-semantic terms, MILK retains meaning as a modern lexical form, but its embodied structure is compressed. M(IE)LK aligns with continuous articulatory flow and is associated with calm, balanced nourishment such as healthy breastfeeding, while M(Iʔ)LK introduces the glottal stop as a control mechanism, reflecting the child’s learned distinction between breathing air and swallowing liquid—the foundational functional role of ʔ.

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      A sound primitive is a primal unit of sound from which sound strings can be developed.  We could classify the resulting sound sequence as a unique sequence of order.  If we can understand the primal meaning of each primitive sound, we can began to form an understanding of n-gram sound sequences.

        Vowels represent continuity, openness, and internal state. They are the elements that allow sound—and meaning—to move. In the body, vowels correspond to sustained airflow and resonance; in the model, they encode process, quality, and condition rather than boundaries. Vowels do not impose limits; they fill space. This is why vowels are associated with sensations like liquidity, balance, emotion, duration, and internal experience. They are what make a sequence feel alive rather than segmented.
		
			<blockquote>What is the state or quality of what is happening?</blockquote>
      </p>
	  
	  <p>
		Consonants, by contrast, represent interruption, boundary, and regulation. They shape, constrain, or redirect flow. In the body, consonants correspond to contact, closure, resistance, or gating; in the model, they encode roles, actions, and control points. Consonants make meaning repeatable and stable by introducing structure into otherwise continuous flow.
		
		<blockquote>Where does flow begin, change, stop, or become organized?</blockquote>
		
	  </p>

		<section class="subsection" id="sp-vowels-general">
      <h4>General Role</h4>
      <p>In our model, a vowel represents open, sustained flow. Physiologically, it corresponds to unobstructed airflow shaped by resonance rather than closure. Functionally, vowels encode state, condition, and continuity—what something is like while it is happening. They do not impose control; they express duration. Meaning carried by vowels is gradient, internal, and adaptive, reflecting experience rather than structure.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
        In this model, vowels can be understood through their relative horizontal (internal–external) and vertical (elevated–descendent) placement, which together indicate their general functional roles. The most vertically elevated vowel is A, yet it remains slightly internal, signaling an introspective or spiritual orientation. As such, A represents an idealized form of order or perfection, akin to the sustained purity of a soprano tone. It corresponds to experiences of transcendence and alignment and may be analogized to the priestly class, whose role centers on maintaining cosmic and ritual order.</p>

 <p>The vowel I is also elevated but oriented outward, with slightly less vertical potential than A. This configuration represents outward elevation—success, visibility, and achievement—often associated with fame or fortune. I is closely tied to fluid motion, with the Nile serving as its clearest natural analogue. In ancient Egypt, prosperity and outward success were inseparable from the rhythms of the Nile’s flow, making the merchant class a fitting social parallel for this vowel.</p>

 <p>At the lowest vertical point lies O, representing profundity and depth. It may evoke the stillness of deep water, the darkness of night, or even the intensity of light. Though slightly internal, O is decisively descendent, aligning with inward depth and foundational inquiry. This vowel corresponds well with the scribal or scholarly class, whose work involves searching beneath surfaces for enduring meaning and structure.</p>

 <p>The vowel U is both external and descendent, representing the outward realities of grounded existence. It encodes contact with uncertainty, instability, and the unmanaged conditions of life. Chaos and variability are key features of U, which aligns with the peasant class, whose lives were most directly shaped by uncontrollable environmental forces.</p>

 <p>At the center of the vowel system stands E, referred to as the monad. Though its articulation is slightly offset from the absolute center, E functions as a point of convergence among the four primary vowels. It represents balance, mediation, and harmonized living—an integration of elevation and descent, inwardness and outwardness. The middle class serves as its social analogue, occupying a position that draws from all domains without being dominated by any single one.</p>

 <p>Above this equilibrium lies Æ, an elevated but distressed variant of E. It is slightly external and clearly raised, resembling the cry of an infant—urgent, unstable, and attention-demanding. Æ represents disequilibrium rather than harmony, signaling a breakdown or strain within the balanced center.</p>

 <p>Finally, slightly descendent yet fully internalized, the glottal stop (ʔ) functions as the null operator of the vowel system. It is not a vowel of experience but of control. Physiologically, it marks the intentional closure of the glottis, halting airflow entirely. In this model, ʔ represents pure regulation—the enforced boundary between one state and the next. It does not express continuity; it creates separation, making structured transitions possible.
      </p>
		</section>
		
		
		<section class="subsection" id="sp-vowels-A">
      <h4>A</h4>
      <p>
        In our model, A occupies the highest vertical position while remaining slightly internal, marking it as the vowel of ideal order rather than outward motion. It represents elevation without dispersion—an experience of coherence, alignment, and completeness that is felt inwardly. A is not about achievement or display; it is about rightness. This is why it is associated with sustained, pure vocalization, where the sound feels resolved and self-sufficient rather than directional.</p>

 <p>Functionally, A encodes a state of maximum organization. It is the vowel closest to perfection in the sense of structural harmony: nothing is missing, and nothing needs to move. In contrast to vowels that emphasize flow or grounding, A stabilizes the system from above, serving as a reference point for balance and proportion. Its slight inward orientation distinguishes it from external success or circulation; the order it represents is internalized and contemplative.</p>

 <p>Within the broader system, A provides a vertical anchor for meaning. Other vowels may rise, fall, or move outward into action, but A defines the upper bound of alignment that makes those movements intelligible. In this sense, A functions as a conceptual apex—an internal ideal that governs the system without needing to intervene directly.
      </p>
		</section>
		
		
		<section class="subsection" id="sp-vowels-I">
      <h4>I</h4>
      <p>
        In our model, I represents outward elevation through circulation and exchange, rather than inward alignment or foundational stability. It is elevated because it operates above the ground level of subsistence, but it is outward because its function depends on interaction with the external world. I does not describe transcendence or abstraction; it describes reach—movement across people, places, and systems. Its elevation comes from visibility, access, and connection, not from internal perfection.</p>

 <p>Functionally, I encodes flow that produces value through motion. It is grounded in outcomes—profit, access, timing, and opportunity—but not anchored to a single place or structure. Like the Nile, which brings fertility through movement rather than stillness, I gains its power from circulation. This makes it dynamic and responsive, but also contingent on conditions beyond its control. Success under I is achieved by navigating flows, not by stabilizing them.</p>

 <p>Within the larger system, I occupies the role of external operator. It translates potential into visible effect by moving resources through the network, without claiming ultimate order (A), depth and permanence (O), or material grounding (U). For this reason, I aligns naturally with the merchant class: those who rise through exchange, mediation, and outward engagement. I is neither ethereal nor foundational—it is situationally grounded, externally elevated, and defined by motion.
      </p>
		</section>
		
		
		<section class="subsection" id="sp-vowels-O">
      <h4>O</h4>
      <p>
In our model, O occupies the lowest vertical position while remaining slightly internal, distinguishing it clearly from both A and I. Where A represents inward elevation and ideal order, and I represents outward elevation through circulation and exchange, O represents depth rather than height. Its meaning is not found in rising or projecting outward, but in descending inward—toward foundations, accumulation, and enduring substance. O is the vowel of profundity, signaling where meaning settles rather than moves.</p>

 <p>Functionally, O encodes contained depth and permanence. It is associated with stillness, storage, and concentration rather than flow. In natural terms, O evokes deep water, the night sky, or enclosed spaces where things are preserved and understood over time. Unlike I, which depends on motion and changing conditions, O derives strength from remaining in place. Its slight inward orientation reflects reflection, internalization, and careful attention to what lies beneath surfaces.</p>

 <p>Within the system, O aligns with the scholarly or scribal function. Scribes do not seek elevation through visibility like I, nor do they embody idealized order like A; instead, they maintain continuity by recording, preserving, and interpreting. O provides the system with depth memory—the capacity to retain meaning across time. It is the vowel of accumulation and understanding, anchoring the language and culture not from above, but from below.
      </p>
		</section>
		
		
		<section class="subsection" id="sp-vowels-U">
      <h4>U</h4>
      <p>
In our model, U occupies the lowest and most external position in the vowel system, distinguishing it from A’s inward elevation, I’s outward elevation, and O’s inward depth. Where the other vowels encode order, circulation, or accumulated meaning, U represents direct contact with external reality. It is grounded not through stability or preservation, but through exposure—life as it is encountered without mediation. U is the vowel of the open field, where conditions are immediate, variable, and often uncertain.</p>

 <p>Functionally, U encodes external grounding under unstable conditions. It corresponds to labor, material necessity, and interaction with forces that cannot be fully controlled. Unlike O, which contains and stores meaning, or I, which moves value through networks, U absorbs impact. Its meaning is shaped by weather, terrain, and circumstance rather than by structure or planning. This makes U essential but volatile: it is where systems are tested against reality.</p>

 <p>Within the larger system, U aligns with the foundational laboring class—those whose work sustains society but is most vulnerable to disruption. U does not aspire upward like I, nor does it stabilize meaning like O, nor does it define ideal order like A. Instead, it anchors the system at its most exposed edge, representing the raw interface between human life and the external world.
      </p>
		</section>
		
		
		<section class="subsection" id="sp-vowels-E">
      <h4>E</h4>
      <p>
In our model, E occupies the central position in both the vertical and horizontal domains, distinguishing it from A’s inward elevation, I’s outward elevation, O’s inward depth, and U’s outward grounding. E does not specialize in height, depth, motion, or exposure; instead, it represents balance among all four. Its role is integrative rather than extreme. Where the other vowels define edges of experience, E defines the center that makes those edges intelligible and livable together.</p>

 <p>Functionally, E encodes convergence and mediation towards a middle way.  Said differently, functionally E is not about action or force; it is about recognition of position. E represents finding one’s position relative to everything else by locating the center where those forces converge. This is why E mediates rather than asserts, regulates rather than commands. It answers the question, “Where am I in relation to everything else?” before any further movement occurs.  E has a meaning similar to <i>ubicarse</i> in Spanish "to get one's bearings" as E encodes orientation, clarity, and contextual awareness. </p>

 <p>Within the broader system, E aligns with balanced social function—the middle ground of lived reality. It represents practical integration: knowing enough of order, exchange, depth, and labor to function effectively without being dominated by any single one. E is therefore the vowel of harmony and continuity, not because it is perfect, but because it is sustainable. It holds the system together by remaining centered, responsive, and relational.
      </p>
		</section>
		
		<section class="subsection" id="sp-vowels-AE">
      <h4>Æ</h4>
      <p>
In our model, Æ is an elevated but unstable vowel, positioned above E yet lacking the inward coherence of A or the directional clarity of I. Where A represents completed order and I represents outward circulation, Æ represents strained elevation—a rise without balance. It is slightly external and clearly lifted, signaling intensity and urgency rather than harmony. Æ does not settle into structure like O, nor does it ground into reality like U; instead, it interrupts the equilibrium that E maintains.</p>

 <p>Functionally, Æ encodes distress, imbalance, and unresolved demand. It resembles a call rather than a state—an expression that demands attention because something is out of alignment. Unlike E, which integrates the system, Æ destabilizes it, indicating pressure, rupture, or transitional stress. In this sense, Æ functions as a diagnostic vowel: it marks moments when balance fails and correction is required. It is not a sustainable position, but a signal that the system is being stretched beyond its stable limits.
      </p>
		</section>
		
		<section class="subsection" id="sp-vowels-glottal">
      <h4>ʔ</h4>
      <p>
In our model, the glottal stop (ʔ) stands apart from all vowels because it is maximally internal and vertically neutral. Unlike A, I, O, U, and E, which occupy positions along the vertical axis of elevation and descent—and unlike Æ, which marks strained elevation—ʔ does not rise or fall. Instead, it withdraws completely inward. It is not a state of experience, aspiration, depth, grounding, or balance; it is the interior point at which experience is suspended altogether. The glottal stop does not participate in vowel space so much as it defines its limits from within.</p>

 <p>Functionally, ʔ encodes absolute internal control. Physiologically, it corresponds to the intentional closure of the glottis, halting airflow entirely. This action is neither elevated nor descendent—it is a pause outside the vertical logic of the system. Semantically, this makes ʔ the null operator of the vowel domain: it contributes no qualitative content, yet it is indispensable. Unlike O, which internalizes meaning through depth, or E, which internalizes balance through mediation, ʔ internalizes regulation itself. It marks the decisive boundary between incompatible states, such as breathing and swallowing, motion and containment.</p>

 <p>Within the broader framework, ʔ represents maximal inwardness without expression. It does not aspire upward like A or I, does not settle downward like O or U, and does not seek equilibrium like E. Nor does it signal instability like Æ. Instead, it enforces the condition that allows all other vowels to function without interference. In this sense, ʔ is foundational not because it carries meaning, but because it is the internal mechanism of control that makes ordered meaning possible at all.

    <p>
In this model, the consonants organize into four functional clusters that reflect degrees of elevation, exposure, and control rather than abstract phonetic categories. These clusters map naturally onto social and practical roles because they encode how action relates to structure, environment, and continuity. The system moves from ordered oversight, through managed outward activity, down to raw labor, and finally inward to preservation and depth.

Group 1 (R · L · D · N · T) occupies the most elevated and internally ordered space. These consonants support administration and management: planning, regulating, naming, and closing processes. Their function is not physical production but coordination—defining roles, boundaries, and sequences so the rest of the system can operate. This group sits closest to ideal structure and oversight, acting as the organizing layer above daily activity.

Below this, Group 2 (S · ch · th · sh) represents cultivated outward activity—work that is external and elevated but still controlled. This is the realm of gardens, workshops, and skilled maintenance: environments shaped by intention rather than brute force. In contrast, Group 3 (M · B · V · P · W · F) represents fully grounded field labor, where work is exposed, repetitive, and physically demanding. Here the consonants are heavier and more embodied, reflecting endurance rather than refinement. Finally, Group 4 ( Y · K · G · H · zh · J · Z ) turns inward, encoding scribal and foundational functions—containment, memory, and internal structure. This group preserves meaning across time, anchoring the system from below rather than directing it from above.
    </p>

		<section class="subsection" id="sp-consonants-1">
      <h4>Group 1: Administrative / managerial class (A–E adjacent)</h4>
	  <h5>R · L · D · N · T</h5>
      <p>
Group 1 (R · L · D · N · T) occupies the upper–internal region of the system, adjacent to A and E, and corresponds to the administrative and managerial function. These consonants are not oriented toward physical production or outward projection; instead, they specialize in ordering, regulation, and closure. Their role is to shape systems—defining relationships, sequencing actions, assigning roles, and determining when processes begin and end. This makes Group 1 the structural backbone of governance rather than an active labor force.

Functionally, these consonants encode control without force. Administration does not move goods, cultivate land, or preserve records directly; it coordinates those activities by setting limits and standards. Sounds in this group tend to feel stabilizing and organizing, reflecting their role in maintaining coherence across complex operations. They operate at a level where decisions affect the system as a whole rather than individual tasks, which is why they align naturally with elevated but inward orientation.

Within the broader model, Group 1 represents the layer of oversight that enables everything else to function efficiently. Without this cluster, labor would lack direction, cultivation would lack planning, and preservation would lack authority. Positioned near A and E, these consonants reflect order that is practical rather than idealized—management that sustains balance rather than striving for transcendence.
      </p>
	  
<h5>R</h5>
<p>
In our model, R occupies an upper–internal position within Group 1, the administrative and managerial consonant cluster adjacent to A and E. Geometrically, R sits elevated but not outward-facing, placing it close to A-space, where ideal order and alignment reside. This positioning reflects R’s role as a conduit between internal structure and external appearance: it does not originate action from below, nor does it project force outward, but instead brings what is internally ordered into perceivable form. Its elevation ties it to authority and clarity, while its inward orientation preserves coherence.

Functionally, R encodes manifestation—the act of making something latent, conceptual, or internally held become visible or real in the world. Unlike A, which represents perfected order as an internal ideal, R represents the moment when that order appears, takes shape, or becomes recognizable. R does not invent structure; it reveals it. This distinguishes R from purely administrative consonants that classify or conclude processes, and from outward consonants that act upon the world without regard to underlying form.

Within the broader system, R plays a critical role in translating ideal alignment into realized presence. It is administrative not because it manages labor, but because it ensures that what ought to exist is properly expressed. Its proximity to A underscores this function: R serves as the consonantal expression of A’s perfection entering visibility. In this way, R anchors authority not in force or motion, but in clear manifestation, allowing order to be recognized, acknowledged, and acted upon by others.
</p>

<h5>L</h5>
<p>
In our model, L occupies an upper position with a balanced orientation between internal and external, within Group 1, adjacent most strongly to A. Geometrically, L does not retreat fully inward nor project outward; instead, it extends smoothly across that boundary while remaining elevated. This gives L a quality of calm authority—present, visible, and stable without being aggressive or forceful. Its elevation aligns it with ideal order, while its balanced orientation allows continuity to be perceived and sustained.

Functionally, L encodes continuity and smooth persistence. It is the consonant of carry-through: the ability for a state, rule, or presence to remain intact over time without interruption. Like F, L balances internal intent and external presence, but unlike F’s regulatory firmness, L is non-worldly and non-procedural. It does not enforce or constrain; it holds. This is why L feels soothing and stabilizing—it allows order to persist naturally rather than through active control.

Within the broader system, L can be likened to a lion seated peacefully on a throne. The power is unquestioned, but it is not being exercised. Proximity to A underscores this: L reflects perfected order already achieved and now maintained through composure rather than action. Where R manifests order and F regulates it, L sustains it effortlessly, embodying elevated continuity that reassures rather than commands.
</p>

<h5>D</h5>
<p>
In our model, D occupies an upper–internal position within Group 1, the administrative and managerial consonant cluster, and it sits close to A-space, where ideal order and elevated alignment reside. Geometrically, D is elevated rather than grounded, and slightly outward, marking action that originates from above the horizon rather than from the field of labor. This placement distinguishes D from consonants that act through force or contact; D acts through authority and reach, extending influence downward without descending into material engagement.

Functionally, D encodes the hand as agency—the capacity to act from a guiding position. It represents deliberate intervention, direction, and adjustment performed by one who oversees rather than endures. Unlike R, which manifests internal order into visible form, or L, which sustains continuity once order is established, D is the consonant of purposeful action taken within an already ordered system. Its proximity to A reflects that this action is aligned with ideal structure rather than reactive necessity.

Within the broader system, D functions as the instrument of administrative will. It does not regulate like F, nor cultivate like Group 2, nor labor like Group 3. Instead, it reaches from elevation to effect change while maintaining distance from the ground. In this sense, D embodies guided agency—action that shapes outcomes without becoming immersed in them, reinforcing its role as the “hand” of authority acting from above.
</p>

<h5>N</h5>
<p>
In our model, N occupies an upper–internal position within Group 1, the administrative and managerial consonant cluster, but it sits closer to the boundary between A and I than other members of the group. Geometrically, N is elevated and inward-facing, aligning it with authority and order, yet it is positioned where inward perfection (A) meets outward circulation (I). This placement makes N inherently relational: it exists not to act unilaterally, but to connect domains that would otherwise remain separate.

Functionally, N encodes the interface operator—the capacity to negotiate, mediate, and manage transitions between elements on either side of it. It does not impose structure like D, sustain it like L, or manifest it like R. Instead, N ensures that different components can interact without conflict, translating between internal principles and external realities. Its closeness to A guarantees alignment with ideal order, while its proximity to I allows it to engage movement, exchange, and outward processes.

Within the broader system, N serves as the administrative mediator. It manages boundaries, handoffs, and interactions, ensuring continuity across divides. In organizational terms, N is the function that allows policy to meet practice and intention to meet execution. Its geometry—elevated, internal, and boundary-adjacent—perfectly reflects this role: N operates above the field of labor, yet precisely at the point where internal order must interface with outward action.
</p>

<h5>T</h5>
<p>
In our model, T occupies an upper position within Group 1, but it is oriented closer to I than to A, placing it at the elevated external edge of administration. Geometrically, T represents a plane or horizon—a flat, extended surface that defines a level of reference rather than an inward ideal. Unlike consonants nearer A, which align with perfection and internal order, T establishes a visible boundary against which movement, position, and action can be measured. Its elevation gives it authority, while its outward orientation makes it perceptible and shared.

Functionally, T encodes the concept of a reference surface: a line, plane, or threshold that separates above from below, before from after, permitted from prohibited. It does not act directly, mediate, or sustain continuity; instead, it defines where action may occur. This aligns it closely with I, which governs outward circulation and activity—T provides the horizon that I-oriented processes move along or up to. In this sense, T is not motion itself, but the framework that makes motion intelligible.

Within the broader system, T serves as the administrative boundary-setter. It marks limits, levels, and endpoints without requiring enforcement or labor. Roads, platforms, thresholds, timelines, and procedural stages all depend on T-like functions. Positioned between inward authority and outward activity, T ensures that elevated action has a clear surface of reference, making it the consonant of measured order at the edge of execution.

      <h4>Group 2: Managed outward activity / cultivated space (I-adjacent)</h4>
	  <h5>S · ch · th · sh</h5>
      <p>
Group 2 (S · ch · th · sh) occupies an outward and elevated position in the system, adjacent to I, and corresponds to cultivated, managed activity. These consonants are associated with environments where work is intentional, selective, and shaped by human choice rather than imposed by necessity. This is not raw labor, but outward engagement that carries an element of refinement—spaces like gardens, courtyards, workshops, and other domains where activity blends productivity with care and often with pleasure.

Functionally, Group 2 encodes articulation and distinction. The work represented here involves knowing when and where to act, what to emphasize, and how to shape outcomes without brute force. These consonants project outward, but they do so with precision rather than pressure. They reflect actions that require attention, timing, and skill, rather than endurance alone. In this sense, Group 2 is elevated relative to field labor because it operates within controlled conditions.

Within the broader model, Group 2 represents the middle layer of outward engagement—situated between administrative oversight and physical labor. It translates planning into visible form while still maintaining a buffer from full exposure. By aligning with I, this group emphasizes circulation, visibility, and cultivated flow, marking the point where structure becomes active without yet becoming burdensome.
      </p>
	  
<h5>S</h5>
<p>
In our model, S occupies an upper–external position within Group 2, the consonant cluster associated with cultivated outward activity. Geometrically, S is elevated and outward-facing, placing it close to I-space, where circulation, visibility, and engagement with the external world dominate. This position distinguishes S from administrative consonants that operate inwardly and from labor consonants that endure exposure. S acts where intention becomes overt action, shaping the world through assertion rather than through force or preservation.

Functionally, S encodes making, enacting, or asserting—the act of causing something to occur or be established. It is not concerned with whether an action is ideal (A), stable (E), or preserved (O); it simply brings action into being. Its proximity to I reflects this outward orientation: S is about initiating visible change, setting processes in motion, and declaring that something now exists or applies. It is lighter and more precise than brute-force labor, emphasizing articulation over endurance.

Within the broader system, S represents the moment of outward realization. It does not regulate like F or sustain continuity like L; instead, it asserts presence and effect. In cultivated environments—gardens, workshops, or managed spaces—S is the consonant of intentional action, where something is made to happen through directed effort rather than raw necessity. Positioned near I, S ensures that elevated intention is translated into observable reality.
</p>

<h5>(ch)</h5>
<p>
In our model, (ch) occupies an upper–external position within Group 2, the consonant cluster associated with cultivated outward activity, and it sits close to I-space, where circulation, visibility, and external engagement dominate. Geometrically, (ch) is elevated and outward-facing, yet it is less sharp or directive than consonants that assert or command. Its placement reflects energy that is expressed and shared, not imposed—active, but not forceful.

Functionally, (ch) encodes activated life-energy: vitality that animates action without violence or coercion. Unlike S, which establishes or asserts, (ch) enlivens—it brings warmth, movement, and responsiveness into a system. This aligns it with cultivated environments where growth, care, and timing matter more than impact. Its proximity to I reinforces this outward vitality: (ch) is energy in circulation, felt and visible, but not destructive or overwhelming.

Within the broader system, (ch) represents the animating force of outward life. It does not preserve meaning like internal priestly consonants, nor does it endure exposure like labor consonants. Instead, it energizes managed activity, making cultivation possible and sustainable. Positioned near I, (ch) bridges intention and living expression, embodying vitality that moves systems forward while remaining controlled and life-affirming.
</p>

<h5>(th)</h5>
<p>
In our model, (th) occupies an outward-facing position at the lower edge of Group 2, where cultivated activity begins to meet raw material engagement. Geometrically, it sits external and slightly descending, placing it closer to U-space than other members of Group 2. This location reflects its role at a boundary—not fully immersed in subsistence labor, yet no longer purely refined or elevated. (th) operates where controlled environments give way to direct contact.

Functionally, (th) encodes the tongue–teeth interface: an action of grasping, tearing, or seizing at an edge. It is neither a blunt strike nor a gentle shaping; instead, it captures and pulls across a boundary. This makes (th) distinct from S or (ch), which act through assertion or vitality. Its proximity to U reflects engagement with material resistance—food, fibers, edges—where action involves exposure and effort, but still retains intention and selectivity.

Within the broader system, (th) represents boundary action in cultivated contexts. It is the consonant of harvesting rather than planting, cutting rather than growing, taking rather than animating. Positioned between Group 2 and Group 3, (th) bridges cultivated outward activity and grounded labor. Its geometry captures this precisely: outward-facing, descending, and edge-oriented—an action that happens exactly where managed life meets the demands of material reality.
</p>

<h5>(sh)</h5>
<p>
In our model, (sh) occupies an outward-facing but descending position at the lower boundary of Group 2, placing it closest to U-space among the cultivated consonants. Geometrically, (sh) sits where elevation begins to soften and outward activity transitions toward grounding. This location reflects its role as a modulator rather than an initiator—it does not act upon the world directly, but adjusts how energy is received and experienced. Its proximity to U signals contact with embodied reality, while its position within Group 2 preserves a degree of care and intentionality.

Functionally, (sh) encodes emotional modulation—the affective shaping of energy into feeling states such as calm, reassurance, sorrow, or attachment. Unlike S, which asserts, or (ch), which animates, (sh) soothes and regulates. The sound itself exemplifies this role: the gentle “shhh” a mother uses to calm an infant, reducing agitation without imposing force. Its closeness to U reflects this grounding function—bringing heightened energy back toward bodily comfort and safety.

Within the broader system, (sh) serves as the emotional interface between cultivated action and physical need. It does not labor, preserve, or command; instead, it attunes. Positioned near U but still within Group 2, (sh) allows outward life to remain humane and responsive, preventing elevation from becoming overstimulation. In this sense, (sh) is the consonant of care—bridging intention and embodiment through feeling rather than force.

	<section class="subsection" id="sp-consonants-3">
      <h4>Group 3: Field labor / subsistence work (U-adjacent)</h4>
	  <h5>M · B · V · P · W · F</h5>
      <p>
Group 3 (M · B · V · P · W · F) occupies the lowest and most external position in the system and corresponds to direct material labor and subsistence activity. These consonants are grounded not through inward containment or symbolic depth, but through exposure to physical reality. They encode contact, pressure, breath, and production—the actions required to work the land, move materials, feed bodies, and sustain daily life. This group represents labor that is unavoidable, repetitive, and physically demanding.

Functionally, Group 3 encodes endurance rather than control. Unlike Group 2, where outward activity occurs within managed and cultivated environments, Group 3 operates in open fields and exposed conditions. Work here is shaped by weather, terrain, and necessity rather than intention or refinement. The consonants themselves feel heavy and embodied, reflecting effort, strain, and persistence rather than articulation or elegance. This is labor without buffer: essential, continuous, and often exhausting.

Within the broader model, Group 3 anchors the system at its most exposed interface with the world. It does not organize like Group 1, cultivate like Group 2, or preserve meaning like Group 4. Instead, it sustains everything else through direct engagement with material conditions. Group 3 is foundational in practice, even if it is lowest in elevation—representing the reality that all higher-order structures ultimately depend on physical labor and survival.
      </p>
	  
<h5>M</h5>
<p>
In our model, M occupies a lower–external position within Group 3, but unlike other consonants in that group, it sits at the boundary, adjacent to Group 2 and particularly near (sh). Geometrically, this places M in a liminal zone between raw labor and managed outward activity. It is still grounded and exposed, close to U-space, yet it retains a degree of internal organization that distinguishes it from purely force-based or contact-based consonants. This boundary position is crucial to understanding M’s function.

Functionally, M encodes turning and modulation rather than linear action. Its core meaning is circulation—movement that curves, reverses, or oscillates rather than simply advancing or pressing forward. This includes turning back, reworking, mixing, or repeatedly cycling through a process. In physical terms, M aligns with actions such as kneading, stirring, milling, or redirecting flow—tasks common in labor contexts but requiring attentiveness rather than brute force. Its adjacency to (sh) reflects this transitional quality: (sh) shapes and refines outward activity, while M turns and redistributes material within it.

Within the broader system, M functions as the hinge consonant of Group 3. It does not merely endure exposure like B or enact downward placement like V; instead, it keeps processes moving by redirecting them. Its proximity to U anchors it in necessity and subsistence, while its closeness to Group 2 allows it to bridge toward cultivated activity. In this way, M represents labor that is not just physical, but process-aware—work that sustains itself through repetition, adjustment, and continual turning rather than straight-line force.
</p>

<h5>B</h5>
<p>
In our model, B occupies a lower–external position within Group 3, adjacent to U-space, and its core semantic meaning is foot—direct contact with the earth. Geometrically, B sits at the point where the body meets the ground, marking grounding through touch rather than containment. Unlike consonants that encode depth (O-adjacent) or regulation (A/E-adjacent), B operates at the surface of reality: where weight is placed, balance is tested, and movement begins. Its downward and outward orientation reflects this immediate interface with terrain.

Functionally, B encodes grounding through contact and support, not abstract stability. The foot does not preserve meaning or impose order; it enables standing, walking, and labor by maintaining continual engagement with the ground. This makes B essential to subsistence activity—planting, walking fields, carrying loads—where presence and traction matter more than structure. Its proximity to U reinforces themes of exposure, effort, and necessity, while its distance from O and E underscores that B is about physical anchoring, not internal reflection or balance. In the system, B represents the most literal form of grounding: the point at which human activity meets the earth itself.
</p>

<h5>V</h5>
<p>
In our model, V primarily encodes downwardness rather than balance or support. Spatially, it sits low and external in Group 3, adjacent to U, but its defining feature is descent—movement or position toward the bottom, not the establishment of a stable base. V does not represent a finished foundation like a floor; it represents what lies below, or the act of moving downward into lower strata. Geometrically, it is oriented toward the bottom of the system without claiming containment or permanence.

Functionally, V marks exposure at the lower edge rather than grounded stability. It is associated with things that fall, sink, are placed beneath, or operate at the underside of a structure. In labor terms, this aligns with work done below—digging, lowering, unloading, or handling what accumulates at the bottom. Its proximity to U reinforces its relationship to gravity, effort, and material reality, while its distance from O and E shows that it does not preserve meaning or mediate balance. V therefore signifies downward placement or condition, not resolution—bottom as direction, not as completion.
</p>


<h5>P</h5>
<p>
In our model, P still sits in the lower–external position within Group 3, adjacent to U-space, but its role within that group is more specific. Geometrically, P is outward and descendent, meaning it operates where classification must be made real in the material world. P represents the act of pressing a distinction into substance—marking, stamping, placing, or partitioning. Unlike administrative classification (Group 1), which defines categories conceptually, P classifies by imposing form through contact. Its articulation—a full closure followed by release—mirrors this function: a decisive act that leaves a mark.

Functionally, P encodes practical classification under labor conditions. It is the sound of sorting grain into piles, setting bricks into courses, planting seeds into rows, or pressing seals into clay. Its proximity to U reflects that this kind of classification occurs under exposure and effort, not abstraction or oversight. P does not decide what the categories are—that belongs to administrative consonants near A/E—but it enacts those categories physically. In this way, P bridges concept and reality, serving as the labor-level execution of classification rather than its design.
</p>

<h5>W</h5>
<p>
In our model, W sits in the lower–external region, firmly within Group 3, the cluster associated with material labor and direct interaction with the world. Geometrically, W is outward-facing and descendent, placing it close to U-space, where exposure, necessity, and physical reality dominate. Unlike elevated consonants that organize or signal, W operates at the interface of breath and contact, translating intention into embodied action. Its placement reflects work done in open conditions—fields, water, tools—where outcomes depend on endurance and adaptability rather than refinement or control.

Functionally, W behaves as a carrier and mover rather than a stabilizer. It is closely allied with U, reinforcing themes of grounding, effort, and sustenance, while remaining distant from the inward depth of O or the elevated order of A and E. W’s consonant quality supports movement of substance—hauling, pushing, guiding—without imposing structure or interpretation. In this sense, W exemplifies the labor class’s role in the system: not to define meaning or preserve it, but to physically enact it, anchoring abstract plans and cultivated spaces in the realities of material work.
</p>
	  
<h5>F</h5>
<p>
In our model, F represents a foundational regulatory function—the point at which flow, movement, or activity is stabilized into a form that can be relied upon, repeated, and managed. Rather than expressing force or impact, F denotes constraint with purpose: the conversion of open-ended motion into a bounded, usable state. Geometrically, F lies where internal intent meets external action, giving it a quality of objectivity that allows meaning to gather from both the internal and external. Embodiment-wise, F corresponds to support, containment, and controlled contact; linguistically, it marks where meaning becomes anchored instead of merely passing through.

Functionally, F aligns with administration and regulation. It is the semantic marker of record-keeping, boundary definition, standards, and oversight—the mechanisms that bring balance to the internal and external. Where F appears, the model predicts durability: forms that resist erosion, meanings that remain stable, and structures capable of transmission across generations. This is why F-type functions are consistently associated with institutions such as accounting, governance, storage, and law. F is not about strength for its own sake, but about making continuity possible through regulation, which is why it occupies a central role in a language and culture designed to endure.

	<section class="subsection" id="sp-consonants-4">
      <h4>Group 4: Priestly / Custodial Class (O-adjacent, maximally internal)</h4>
	  <h5>Y · K · G · H · zh · J · Z</h5>
      <p>
Group 4 (Y · K · G · H · zh · J · Z) occupies a deeply internal position, adjacent to O, but its depth should be understood as interiority rather than physical grounding. Unlike Group 3, which is grounded through direct contact with material reality, Group 4 withdraws inward. Its consonants encode containment, resonance, and internal force—actions that operate below the surface of visible activity. This inward orientation aligns the group not with labor, but with priestly, contemplative, and preservational functions.

Functionally, Group 4 governs internal coherence and continuity. These consonants support practices that stabilize meaning across time rather than space: ritual preservation, doctrinal memory, controlled utterance, and guarded knowledge. Their articulation is less exposed and less forceful, reflecting roles that require restraint, secrecy, and internal discipline. Where Group 2 shapes the external environment and Group 3 endures it, Group 4 maintains the unseen structures that give those activities legitimacy and meaning.

Within the broader system, Group 4 represents the internal custodial layer of society. It does not manage outward order like Group 1, nor cultivate or produce like Groups 2 and 3. Instead, it safeguards the symbolic, ceremonial, and conceptual foundations that allow the system to persist beyond immediate conditions. In this sense, Group 4 is priestly not because it is elevated, but because it is maximally internalized, operating in depth rather than height.
      </p>
	  
<h5>Y</h5>
<p>
In our model, Y occupies a lower–internal position within Group 4, the priestly/internal cluster, but it sits at the boundary of that group, directly adjacent to F. Geometrically, this places Y at a critical interface: it remains inward and depth-oriented like O-adjacent consonants, yet it points toward execution rather than containment. Whereas most of Group 4 withdraws inward to preserve, guard, or internalize meaning, Y is the point where internal force becomes directed. Its placement mirrors O across the internal axis—both are inward, but O accumulates and holds, while Y aims.

Functionally, Y encodes directed force or focused agency. It is not diffuse power and not raw impact; instead, it represents intentional strike, targeting, or alignment of force toward a specific end. This distinguishes Y from purely priestly custody and from administrative regulation. Its adjacency to F is essential: F stabilizes and regulates, while Y acts once regulation is established. In this way, Y behaves as the internal counterpart to external labor force—force that is controlled, aimed, and purposeful rather than exposed or repetitive.

Within the broader system, Y serves as the bridge between internal authority and outward effect. It does not perform labor like Group 3, nor does it simply preserve doctrine like the core of Group 4. Instead, it represents moments when profound internal decision, ritual authority, or sanctioned intent is released into action. This makes Y a boundary consonant: priestly in origin, operational in consequence. Its geometry reflects this dual role—anchored in internal depth near O, yet oriented toward F, where intention becomes structured action.
</p>

<h5>K</h5>
<p>
In our model, K occupies a lower–internal position within Group 4, the priestly and deeply internal consonant cluster adjacent to O-space. Geometrically, K sits inward and below the central axis, far from outward exposure and elevated projection. Like its paired counterpart G, K is associated with force and resistance, but its orientation is not toward immediate obstruction. Instead, its inward placement signals force that is conceptualized, contained, and contemplated, rather than enacted directly. This distinguishes K from Group 3 labor consonants and aligns it with internal power that exceeds ordinary material scale.

Functionally, K mirrors G while diverging in scope. Where G represents bounded resistance—a hard stop, obstruction, or constraint that halts motion—K represents unbounded or infinite force. It is not the wall that stops movement, but the vastness that overwhelms it. K encodes force that cannot be easily measured or contained: scale beyond finitude, extension without clear limit, or power that exceeds human management. This contrast explains why the two are paired: G defines the limit, while K defines what lies beyond it.

Within the broader system, K serves as the internal marker of overwhelming magnitude. It does not regulate like F, direct like Y, or preserve like the core of Group 4; instead, it frames the outer bounds of what can be resisted or constrained at all. Its proximity to O reinforces its inward, contemplative character—K is force understood abstractly rather than experienced physically. Together, K and G define a critical internal polarity: G sets the boundary; K reveals the boundlessness beyond it.
</p>

<h5>G</h5>
<p>
In our model, G occupies a lower–internal position within Group 4, the priestly and deeply internal consonant cluster adjacent to O-space. Geometrically, G sits inward and descendent, far from outward exposure or cultivated action. This placement reflects its role as an internalized constraint rather than an externally applied force. Unlike Group 3 consonants that encounter resistance through labor, G represents resistance that is structural and intrinsic—a limit encountered from within the system itself.

Functionally, G encodes bounded resistance: the hard stop, obstruction, or constraint that prevents further motion. Where K gestures toward infinite or overwhelming scale, G defines the edge where motion must cease. It is the consonant of walls, gates, seals, and prohibitions—points at which continuation is no longer possible without transformation. This makes G essential for maintaining integrity: without bounded resistance, systems would collapse into excess or dispersion.

Within the broader framework, G acts as the internal governor of force. It does not create balance like E, regulate interaction like F, or direct intent like Y. Instead, it establishes limits that cannot be ignored, ensuring that power—whether material, symbolic, or conceptual—remains contained. Its proximity to O reinforces its inward, preservational role: G protects depth by preventing uncontrolled expansion. Paired with K, G completes the polarity of force in the system—K names the limitless; G defines the boundary that makes limit meaningful at all.
</p>

<h5>H</h5>
<p>
In our model, H occupies a lower–internal position within Group 4, the priestly and inward custodial cluster, and it lies very near the glottal stop (ʔ). Geometrically, this places H deep inside the system, away from outward action and elevation, yet not at the point of total arrest. It sits close to O-space, sharing interiority and depth, but its proximity to ʔ is decisive: H exists at the threshold where flow is still present, just before it can be completely shut off. This makes H internal, subtle, and foundational without being constraining.

Functionally, H encodes breath itself—baseline life-energy and respiration without applied force. Unlike Y, which directs force, or G, which blocks it, H allows flow to exist in its most minimal, unshaped form. It is neither motion nor stoppage, but the condition that makes both possible. Physiologically, this aligns cleanly with breathing as a continuous, low-level process that sustains life without intention. Its nearness to the glottal stop highlights this role: H is what is present when the glottis is open but no articulation or pressure has yet been imposed.

Within the broader system, H represents internal vitality rather than action or structure. It does not preserve meaning like scribal depth (O), regulate interaction like F, or impose limits like G. Instead, it maintains the living interior field in which all other functions operate. In priestly terms, H corresponds to the quiet sustaining breath beneath ritual, doctrine, and authority—the invisible continuity that persists unless deliberately interrupted by ʔ.
</p>

<h5>(zh)</h5>
<p>
In our model, (zh) occupies a lower–internal position within Group 4, the priestly and inward custodial cluster adjacent to O-space. Geometrically, (zh) is internal like H, G, and K, but it is less static and less restraining. It sits inward and descendent, yet closer to expressive emergence than to containment or arrest. This places (zh) between deep interiority and subtle outward manifestation—still internal, but no longer inert.

Functionally, (zh) encodes radiant or shimmering vitality: energy that is alive, animated, and perceptible, yet not forceful or directive. Unlike H, which represents baseline breath and quiet life-energy, (zh) represents activated interior energy—the glow that arises when breath, intention, and presence begin to cohere. It is not the infinite force of K, nor the hard boundary of G, nor the aimed strike of Y. Instead, it is expressive vitality without impact, like light flickering within a contained space.

Within the broader system, (zh) aligns naturally with ritual animation and priestly expression. It is the consonant of chant resonance, sacred illumination, and symbolic vitality—energy that is meant to be sensed rather than applied. Its proximity to O reflects its inward depth, while its difference from purely static consonants marks it as alive and luminous, not merely preserved. In this sense, (zh) represents the moment when internal life-energy becomes visible as radiance, without crossing into outward action or labor.
</p>

<h5>J</h5>
<p>
In our model, J occupies a lower–internal position within Group 4, but it is positioned closer to the vertical influence of A than other consonants in its cluster. Geometrically, this places J inward and contemplative, yet oriented toward elevated clarity rather than depth alone. While it remains O-adjacent in its internality, its nearness to A signals that J participates in refined recognition rather than preservation or containment. It is inward judgment lifted toward ideal order.

Functionally, J encodes discernment at its most precise—the capacity to recognize, evaluate, and distinguish without yet acting. Unlike Y, which converts internal intent into directed force, or F, which regulates action into stability, J remains purely cognitive. Its closeness to A reflects discernment that seeks correctness and alignment, not merely differentiation. J does not decide what to do; it determines what is true, fitting, or properly understood.

Within the broader system, J represents priestly or elite cognitive authority: interpretation that approaches perfection without claiming enactment. It is distinct from scribal depth (O), which preserves meaning through repetition, and from (zh), which animates vitality. J clarifies meaning by aligning perception with ideal form. In this sense, J mirrors A’s perfection inwardly, serving as the consonantal expression of clear, ordered understanding before action begins.
</p>

<h5>Z</h5>
<p>
In our model, Z occupies a lower–internal position within Group 4, the priestly and inward custodial consonant cluster, but it is distinguished by its strong vertical relationship to A. Geometrically, Z is internal rather than outward, yet it is oriented upward in influence: it receives rather than projects. While other Group 4 consonants emphasize containment, judgment, or latent force, Z marks the point where illumination enters the internal domain. Its placement reflects interior clarity derived from above, not from accumulation or action.

Functionally, Z encodes “light-from-above”—radiant illumination, clarity, or revealed presence. Unlike J, which discerns through cognition, Z clarifies through revelation. It does not evaluate; it discloses. This makes Z distinct from A itself: A represents perfected order and alignment, while Z represents the experience of that perfection becoming visible within the system. Z is therefore receptive rather than generative—illumination arriving, not being constructed.

Within the broader system, Z serves as the internal consonant of revelation. It is priestly not because it preserves doctrine (O) or enforces limits (G), but because it marks moments when understanding is granted rather than derived. Its proximity to A reinforces this role: Z reflects ideal order downward into interior awareness, translating perfection into clarity. In this way, Z functions as the consonantal bridge between transcendent order and internal recognition—the light that makes discernment possible without effort.

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      A sound primitive is a foundational unit of sound from which more complex sound strings can be constructed. In this chapter, we have introduced the set of sound primitives derived from the Sound Wheel. The Sound Wheel can be tested directly by the user against any sound string, demonstrating its functional validity in practice.
    </p>
	
	</p>
	While future work may refine the system by adding, removing, or slightly repositioning individual sound primitives, the core structure of the Sound Wheel remains intact. Through a grounded-theory framework, it has been established not as a speculative model, but as an objective method for organizing and measuring sound data based on observable functional behavior.
	</p>
	
	<p>The meanings assigned to these sound primitives are anchored in their geometric relationships and spatial correlations. At this stage, they function as interpretive placeholders, intended to be refined through application to real-world language data. These interpretative foundations are expected to evolve over time, updating and sharpening as the model is tested against empirical examples.</p>
	
	
<p>
Grounded theory separates what is observed to be stable from what is provisionally interpreted. The Sound Wheel’s geometry and spatial relationships constitute the grounded foundation: they are derived from repeated observation of how sounds function relative to one another (flow vs. arrest, internal vs. external, elevation vs. descent). These relationships are treated as structural facts—they are not hypothesized meanings, but organizing constraints that consistently recur across applications. This satisfies grounded theory’s requirement that theory emerge from patterned behavior rather than prior assumptions.
</p>

<p>
The meanings assigned to sound primitives, by contrast, are explicitly framed as interpretative placeholders. In grounded theory terms, these function like initial codes: tentative labels that help the researcher work with the data without claiming final truth. As the model is applied to real language examples, these placeholders are expected to shift, split, merge, or sharpen. This iterative refinement—where interpretation is constantly tested against data and revised accordingly—is a core principle of grounded theory, not a departure from it.
</p>

<p>
Crucially, grounded theory allows interpretative categories to change without destabilizing the underlying structure. Separating geometry from interpretation is essential.  This is why the framework preserves this separation: the Sound Wheel’s geometry remains stable, while semantic interpretations evolve through use. This ensures that meaning is not imposed top-down, but earns its validity through repeated alignment with linguistic data, which is exactly how grounded theory transforms provisional insight into robust explanation over time.

</figure>

	<h5>Setup</h5>
    <p>
      I select the word FAI in the Egyptian because it is in a section with several different words that refer to bearing a burden, to carry a weight (Budge V1, pdf page 419: there are over a dozen similar entries about this same theme).
    </p>
	
	<h5>Prompt to (ChatGPT)</h5>
	<p><blockquote>In the model, how does FAI relate to bearing or carrying a burden of weight. Which would have better meaning FAI or merely FA?</blockquote>
	</p>
	
	<h5>Response from (ChatGPT)</h5>
	<p>
	<h6>FA — static foundation / support</h6>

F (regulation, stabilization) combined with A (ideal order, elevated alignment) yields FA as properly placed support or structural correctness. FA refers to a state where something is set correctly and can bear weight in principle because it is aligned, ordered, and stable. It is the idea of a foundation, a base, or a load-bearing condition viewed from above, without reference to motion or ongoing effort.

FA answers the question:  Is this positioned correctly to bear weight?

It is architectural, administrative, and ideal—support as a condition, not as an experience.


<h6>FAI — bearing a burden through sustained load</h6>

When I is added, the meaning shifts decisively. I introduces flow, circulation, and outward movement—in physical terms, water or life in motion. FAI therefore encodes bearing weight while energy is moving through the system. This is not just being capable of support, but actively carrying a burden over time, under strain, and in visible conditions.

FAI answers the question: Can this continue to carry weight while life moves through it?

This is the difference between: 
<ul>
<li>A pillar correctly placed (FA) </li>
<li>A person, animal, or structure carrying a load while moving (FAI)</li>
</ul>
	
	
	</p>
	
	<h5>Summary of Response</h5>
	<p><blockquote>FA denotes correct, ideal support, while FAI denotes the lived act of bearing or carrying a burden as weight moves through the system.</blockquote>
	</p>
	
	
	<h5>Commentary</h5>
    <p>
	Again to quote ChatGPT: "Budge entry strongly confirms the explanation, and in a way that is unusually clean."  It is almost as-if the LLM does not like how good the response fit the data.  
	
	The Budge entry aligns with the proposed explanation in a notably direct way. While it would be possible to pursue a detailed examination of individual glyph forms and trace the full historical development of the sign F, doing so at this early stage would risk embedding inherited traditions prematurely into the model. Since the framework is still being established, restraint is methodologically important.

At this point, it is sufficient to observe a loose but consistent confirmation: FA corresponds to foundational or organizing stabilization, while the addition of I introduces movement and circulation. This allows meanings such as bearing, lifting, and beginning a journey to emerge naturally from function, without requiring symbolic or historically fixed interpretations.

  </figcaption>
</figure>

	<h5>Setup</h5>
    <p>
      I select the word GI in the Egyptian because it is in a section with several different words that refer to the act of doing something.
    </p>
	
	<h5>Prompt to (ChatGPT)</h5>
	<p><blockquote>How would GI mean "the act of" doing something</blockquote>
	</p>
	
	<h5>Response from (ChatGPT)</h5>
	<p>
	 Within your model, <strong>GI</strong> can mean <q>the act of doing</q> because of how
    <strong>G</strong> and <strong>I</strong> interact functionally and geometrically.
	
	
	<h6>G: Bounded resistance / constraint</h6>
  <p>
    <strong>G</strong> encodes <em>bounded resistance</em> or <em>constraint</em>—the moment where
    potential meets a limit and something must take form. It marks the point at which action is no longer
    hypothetical: a boundary is encountered, a threshold is crossed, or a condition is imposed that forces
    definition. On its own, <strong>G</strong> is static: a stop, a rule, a hard edge that prevents motion
    from remaining indefinite.
  </p>
  
  <h6>I: Outward flow / circulation</h6>
  <p>
    <strong>I</strong>, by contrast, encodes outward flow, circulation, and movement—the transition into visible,
    lived activity. When <strong>I</strong> follows a consonant, it does not merely add motion; it indicates that
    whatever the consonant defines is carried forward into experience.
  </p>

  <h6>GI: Constrained possibility released into motion</h6>
  <p>When combined as <strong>GI</strong>, the meaning becomes:</p>

  <blockquote class="key-definition">
    <p>the moment a constrained possibility is released into motion.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    In other words, <strong>GI</strong> marks the act itself, not the plan (<strong>A/E</strong>), not the force
    (<strong>Y/S</strong>), and not the outcome (<strong>R</strong>), but the execution—the doing that occurs when a
    boundary is engaged and movement proceeds. This is why <strong>GI</strong> can function as an
    <em>action nominalizer</em>: it turns a constrained condition (<strong>G</strong>) into a performed act
    (<strong>I</strong>).
  </p>
  
	
	</p>
	
	
	<h5>Prompt to (ChatGPT)</h5>
	<p><blockquote>What is the Greek written here.  What does it mean. (I attached the first entry that is only Greek)</blockquote>
	</p>
	
	<h5>Response from (ChatGPT)</h5>
	
	<p>
	The Greek written there is: τὸ προσῆκον (to prosêkon) which means:
	<ul>
		<li>“what is fitting”</li>
		<li>“what is proper”</li>
		<li>“what is appropriate / due”</li>
		<li>“what ought to be done”</li>
	</ul>
	
	It comes from the verb προσήκω (prosḗkō), meaning to be fitting, to pertain, to be proper or incumbent. In Classical and Hellenistic Greek, τὸ προσῆκον is often used in ethical, legal, and administrative contexts to denote the correct or required action given a situation.
	
	This gloss is especially significant because it aligns cleanly with your GI interpretation:

<ul>
<li>
G → bounded constraint / obligation / rule
</li>

<li>
I → outward enactment / movement into reality
</li>
</ul>

Together, GI naturally maps to “the act that is required or fitting”, not just motion, but properly constrained action. That is exactly what τὸ προσῆκον expresses: the doing of what is due.


	</p>
	
	
	
	
	
	<h5>Commentary</h5>
    <p>
	Again to quote ChatGPT: "This is a strong semantic confirmation rather than a loose analogy."
	
	Although we cannot yet be certain that the primitive symbol G has been definitively identified in Egyptian, this analysis is nevertheless affirming. Within the model, G represents an internal constraint that, when externalized through I, yields action. The accompanying Greek evidence further clarifies this relationship by indicating that such action is not arbitrary, but proper and fitting—action taken in accordance with internal rules or limits defined by G and realized through I.

    <strong>Budge M:</strong> as a preposition seems to represent "in" or "upon".

  </figcaption>
</figure>


	
	<h5>Prompt to (ChatGPT)</h5>
	<p><blockquote>Can M represent a general proposition meaning "in" "at" "upon" and so on. How would that fit the model</blockquote>
	
	<blockquote>What is a better fit for this proposition? M or EM?</blockquote>
	</p>
	
	<h5>Response from (ChatGPT)</h5>
	<p>
	Within your model, EM is the better and more precise fit than M for a general proposition like “in / at / upon” when the meaning is situational placement rather than mere participation.
	
	<h6>M alone: participation within a process</h6>
	<p>
	M encodes turning, modulation, and internal circulation. When used by itself as a proposition, it places something within an ongoing activity or process, not within a stable location. M answers:
<ul>
<li>What is this engaged in? </li>
<li>What process is it caught up in or moving within?</li>
</ul></p>

<p>
This works well for meanings like:
<ul>
<li>in the act of</li>

<li>within the process of</li>

<li>engaged in</li>
</ul>

But it is too dynamic to cleanly express simple locative relations like “at the house” or “in the city” unless the context is explicitly procedural.</p>

<h6>EM: situated presence / located within</h6>

<p>
Adding E changes everything.</p>

<p>
E is the monad: orientation, balance, situating, <i>ubicarse</i>. When E precedes M, the result is not motion or turning, but situated participation—being placed within a context rather than merely circulating through it.</p>

<p>
So EM means being properly situated within an ongoing context or location.</p>

<p>
It answers "Where is this, relative to the whole?"</p>

<p>
This makes EM ideal for:
<ul>
<li>in</li>

<li>at</li>

<li>upon</li>
</ul> </p>

<p>
That is, locative without depth (O) and without motion (I).
</p>


<p>M expresses participation in a process, while EM expresses being situated within a context; for general locative meaning, EM is the better fit. </p>

	</p>
	
	

	
	
	<h5>Commentary</h5>
    <p>
	Because M encodes turning or modulation, it can naturally function as a prepositional operator. However, the interpretation EM provides a more robust account of locative meaning, capturing not only participation but proper situating within a context. When we examine the corresponding hieroglyphic symbol, we again encounter the owl. This raises the possibility that the owl functions as a bigram, representing the primitive sound sequence EM, rather than a single isolated value.
	</p>
	
	<p>At present, we cannot definitively identify the primitive root glyph for M, although it has been provisionally defined as turning or modulation based on glyph Aa15. This interpretation, however, does not rely solely on that glyph. The meaning of turning and modulation also emerges directly from M’s geometric position on the Sound Wheel, particularly in relation to breathing dynamics. Situated adjacent to U, M occupies the point at which the inhalation–exhalation cycle reverses direction, providing a physiological basis for its interpretive value.</p>

<p>Further support comes from the visual behavior of the owl associated with EM. The owl’s well-known ability to rotate its head offers a clear physical example of turning without bodily displacement, closely mirroring the concept of modulation. This visual symbolism reinforces the interpretation of M as turning and directional reversal, even if Aa15 ultimately proves not to be the primitive glyph for this sound.

	<h5>Prompt to (ChatGPT)</h5>
	<p><blockquote>Could M, EM, GEM mean "turn" and "look" and "see"</blockquote>
	</p>
	
	<h5>Response from (ChatGPT)</h5>
	<p>Within the model, M naturally carries the meaning of turning or modulation. It describes a change in orientation or direction understood as a process rather than a single action. This includes turning the body, redirecting attention, or shifting a state without displacement. As such, M provides a foundational operation from which more specific perceptual actions can be built.</p>
<p>
When E is added, the resulting form EM represents turning with the purpose of orientation. E contributes situating and contextual awareness—finding one’s place within a field. Together, EM describes the act of turning in order to locate or align perception, which corresponds closely to the everyday meaning of to look. This interpretation is reinforced by the owl motif associated with EM, whose characteristic head rotation embodies attentive reorientation without bodily movement.</p>
<p>
Adding G yields GEM, which extends looking into defined recognition. G introduces constraint and definition, transforming oriented attention into a resolved percept. In this form, seeing is not merely directing attention, but arriving at clarity—recognition that something has taken shape within awareness. The sequence M → EM → GEM thus traces a coherent progression from turning, to looking, to seeing.</p>
<p>
A further refinement appears with JEM, where J contributes discernment and evaluative cognition without enacting action. In this form, looking becomes an act of active distinction and interpretation, guided by judgment rather than simple recognition or execution. Perception is no longer passive; it becomes discerning observation, capable of differentiating significance and meaning while remaining internally suspended. This extension preserves the internal logic of the system, demonstrating how increasingly refined cognitive functions emerge through the systematic composition of sound primitives.

	</p>
	
	

	
	
	<h5>Commentary</h5>
    <p>
	In this example, we extend our conjectures into a coherent, engineered system. If this language were to be taught to others, it would require concrete, repeatable examples that clearly illustrate how meaning is constructed. For that reason, the progression to turn, to look, to see was proposed as a test case, along with an estimate of how these meanings might be expressed in Egyptian.</p>
	
	
	<p>

The resulting sequence—M, EM, GEM—forms a structurally consistent answer. Each step builds logically on the previous one, demonstrating how increasingly refined perceptual acts emerge through systematic composition of sound primitives rather than isolated definitions.  And the added insight by ChatGPT of JEM was a bonus "gem".

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
     In the course of deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs (started in 1808), Jean-François Champollion (born December 23, 1790) introduced the concept of the determinative: a sign that, while written, was not pronounced, but served to classify or disambiguate the meaning of a word. This interpretation emerged between 1822 and 1824 as a practical solution to a real problem—how to explain the presence of recurring signs that did not appear to contribute phonetic value. Determinatives allowed Champollion to stabilize readings, manage homophones, and scale decipherment across a large corpus. Within the intellectual context of early 19th-century philology, the concept was both ingenious and necessary.
    </p>
	
	<p>However, when examined through a mathematical (Champollion was not a mathematician) or systems-oriented lens, the determinative model reveals a structural flaw. If two words are homophonous in speech but distinguished only by a silent element in writing, then the mapping from speech to writing is not invertible. In other words, semantic information encoded in the written form is lost when the text is rendered back into speech. For a language intended to function in public recitation, ritual performance, legal proclamation, and pedagogy over thousands of years, such lossiness presents a serious problem. A non-reversible encoding violates a basic principle of robust communication systems: meaning must be recoverable across transformations.
	
	</p>
	<p>An alternative interpretation is therefore warranted—one that preserves Champollion’s empirical insights while re-evaluating the nature of determinatives themselves. Rather than being silent classifiers, these signs may have belonged to an embodied list of known pronunciations (200 or so glyphs): vocalized classifiers, compressed sound sequences, prosodic markers, or structural n-grams that were meaningful in speech but later collapsed or obscured. In this view, the “determinative list” preserved in writing reflects a repertoire of sound–meaning operators that speakers could recover through pronunciation, rhythm, or articulation, even if modern scholarship no longer recognizes their phonetic realization.</p>
	<p>
	Such a solution is more robust with respect to reversibility. If every written distinction corresponds to some recoverable feature in speech—whether phonetic, prosodic, or structural—then the mapping between spoken and written language remains invertible in principle. This aligns with modern mathematical notions of encoding and decoding, where lossless systems preserve all information necessary for reconstruction. While these concepts would have been foreign to Champollion’s skillset and historical context, applying them today does not undermine his achievement. Rather, it extends it, reframing determinatives not as silent exceptions to language, but as evidence of a richer, more tightly engineered sound–symbol system than has traditionally been acknowledged.

    <p>
      This is an example of a potential determinant.  The homophone REMI (libation) and REMI (eye weeping) maybe be distinguishable by the determinant.  This is the reason Champollion after spending 14 years deciphering hieroglyphs introduced this concept.  However, the mathematics of reversibility was not considered when he labeled them as silent.  They were silent to his study because in the languages he was using to pronounce Egyptian (most notably Coptic), the word had a short pronunciation that did not include the determinant sounds.  So he concluded, naturally, that the determinant was silent and this was bothersome because he recognized that the written and the spoken were not interchangeable.
    </p>
	
<div class="figure-pair" role="group" aria-label="Side-by-side figures">

</div>


<p>
Within the model, REMI can coherently denote either tears or a libation, because both are instances of the same functional structure: manifested, modulated, outward flow of living water.

<ul>
<li>
R (manifestation) brings an internal state or intent into perceivable reality.</li>
<li>
E (situating / emotional center) locates that state within a balanced, meaningful context.</li>
<li>
M (modulation / turning) works the release through a controlled, cyclic process rather than a single burst.</li>
<li>
I (flowing water / outward circulation) carries the result into visible, external space.</li>
</ul>

When the source is internal emotion, REMI resolves as tears—a regulated release that makes inner state visible without collapse or force. When the source is ritual intent, REMI resolves as a libation—water intentionally poured, modulated, and directed outward to manifest offering and continuity. In both cases, the meaning is not “water” alone, but water-as-manifested expression, whether physiological or ceremonial.

</p>


<h4>Disambiguation</h4>
      <p>
        As noted in other examples involving REMI, both the libation symbol and the eye-with-tears symbol are attested. One possible interpretation is that the initial occurrence functions much like a definition or gloss—establishing REMI for subsequent use in the text. Thereafter, REMI could refer to either a libation or tears. The difficulty with this approach arises when both meanings appear within the same textual context, where ambiguity would otherwise result.</p>

</p>This is precisely where the determinative serves its proper disambiguating role. While REMI may function as a shared phonetic form, the determinative clarifies the intended meaning in context. For this system to work effectively, libation and tears must retain distinct vocal or semantic signatures, even if they are homophonous at the phonetic level. In a ritual context—such as a temple ceremony—both expressions could plausibly appear as REMI-libation and REMI-tears. Although they share the same core phonetic structure, the determinative, understood as part of the spoken form, provides the necessary clarification of meaning.
      </p>


<h4>Compression and Categorization</h4>
      <p>
       Determinatives such as libation and eye-with-tears need not be assumed to be monosyllabic. It is plausible that they functioned as multi-syllabic elements, with a finite list of such determinatives—perhaps on the order of 150–200—being taught explicitly within the Egyptian educational system. These could have been learned as key terms with memorized pronunciations, serving as standardized semantic anchors. Because each determinative is integrated into the broader structure of the language, it is reasonable to expect that many could decompose into multi-syllabic sound representations despite appearing as single visual signs.</p>

  <p>If the metadata surrounding the original creation of these elements has been lost, the question becomes whether it can be recovered from the data itself. For example, a libation sign visually depicts a vessel with liquid flowing outward; such imagery invites analysis in terms of primitive functional components—container, flow, release—that could correspond to specific sound primitives. This raises the possibility that the sound associated with “libation” in Egyptian might be reconstructible by decomposing the symbol into its operational elements. Similarly, an eye with multiple tears could be analyzed as a composite of vision, manifestation, and flowing liquid, potentially yielding recoverable phonetic structure given sufficient linguistic evidence.</p>

  <p>A robust language system would also require a definitional mechanism for introducing new determinatives, and traces of such mechanisms may be embedded within the extensive hieroglyphic record. The essential point is that while Champollion correctly emphasized the importance of determinatives for disambiguation, a language capable of enduring for millennia would almost certainly have vocalized these elements as well. If the full semantic content of words with their determinatives was not shared with interacting foreign cultures, it is reasonable that homophonic forms without determinatives could have entered those languages as isolated survivals—such as in Coptic—detached from their original semantic frameworks.

<p>In Coptic, the first glyph shown corresponds to ⲙ (mi). Within the model, this allows for a pronunciation reconstructed as MI(OU). Interpreted functionally, MI(OU) can denote cat: a modulating, alert, outwardly animated creature that alternates between surface contact and interior depth. This description aligns closely with feline movement, perception, and spatial behavior.

For this reason, we proceed using MI(OU) as the working form, as it aligns more closely with the Coptic evidence than the MAU reconstruction proposed by Budge.</p>


<h4>Purring</h4>

    <strong>Budge HAI:</strong> is this a generic classification for the feline?
  Source: Budge V1 (pdf page 601, RHS)
  </figcaption>
</figure>	

	
	<p>Within the model, HAI can plausibly function as a generic classificatory form for “cat”, with H playing a central role through its association with breath and baseline life-energy—specifically purring breath.
	
	</p>
	
	<p>H encodes breath without applied force: respiration as continuous, low-pressure vitality rather than directed action or exertion. This aligns closely with purring, which is not a vocalized signal in the ordinary sense, but a regulated oscillation of breath and laryngeal vibration. Purring occurs during inhalation and exhalation, reinforcing H’s position near the glottal stop as sustained airflow without arrest or strike. In this sense, H captures a defining physiological trait of cats: a calm, internally generated life-signal that communicates presence, comfort, and continuity rather than intent or action.
	
	</p>
	
	<p>A contributes ideal or archetypal alignment, lifting the form from an individual instance to a class-level identity. With A, the breath encoded by H is no longer merely situational; it becomes characteristic. HA therefore suggests a type defined by its living quality, not by function or labor. The addition of I then places this archetype into external circulation and recognition—the animal as it is encountered, observed, and named in the world. I does not add motion in the sense of pursuit or work, but visibility and life-in-flow.
	
	</p>
    
	<p>Taken together, HAI describes a living archetype defined by calm, continuous breath, elevated to a recognizable class and encountered outwardly. This makes it well suited as a generic classification for “cat”, distinct from MI(OU), which emphasizes feline motion and spatial behavior. Where MI(OU) captures how cats move, HAI captures what cats are: breathing, purring, self-contained life-forms whose presence is felt even in stillness.</p>

<p>
Within the model, SET is more accurate than SED for “tail” because a tail functions primarily as a terminal boundary and balancing extension, not as an instrument of directed agency. S correctly establishes extension or enactment in both cases, and E situates that extension relationally within the body as a whole. The crucial distinction lies in the final consonant: T encodes a plane, horizon, or limit, whereas D encodes guided action or manipulation from above. A tail marks where the body ends; it does not “act” in the way a hand or tool does.</p>
<p>
Using SED subtly mischaracterizes the tail as an agent—something shaped or operated with intent. While tails do move, their movement is expressive or stabilizing rather than deliberative. They follow the body’s dynamics rather than directing them. SET, by contrast, captures the tail as a properly situated terminal extension: an endpoint that defines balance, orientation, and completion without implying control. This aligns with tails across species, whether used for balance, signaling, or counterweight.</p>
<p>
For these reasons, SET better reflects the functional and geometric reality of a tail within the system. It encodes extension (S), relational placement (E), and terminal boundary (T)—precisely the qualities that make a tail what it is. SED may remain viable for shaped appendages or guided extensions, but for the anatomical and symbolic role of a tail, SET provides the more accurate and structurally consistent representation.
</p>


<h4>Disambiguation of MI(OU)</h4>
<p>Within the model, a sequence such as MI(OU) HAI SET can be understood as a layered disambiguation strategy, illustrating how determinatives may have been optionally vocalized. MI(OU) functions as the primary vocalization for cat, capturing the animal’s characteristic modulation, alertness, and alternation between surface contact and interior depth. In most contexts, MI(OU) alone would be sufficient to identify the referent.</p>

<p>If clarification were required, the determinative—represented visually by the seated cat sign (𓃠, Gardiner E13)—could also be spoken as HAI. As previously identified, HAI plausibly encodes a generic classification of the cat, grounded in H as purring breath or baseline life-energy, elevated to an archetypal category by A, and made externally recognizable through I. In this way, the determinative is not silent, but an available vocal reinforcement when precision is needed.</p>

<p>Should further specification be necessary, SET could be added to emphasize tail, highlighting a defining anatomical feature. Taken together, MI(OU) HAI SET demonstrates how determinatives could function as optional, vocalizable clarifiers, layered onto a primary word form rather than replacing it. This approach preserves Champollion’s insight about determinatives while reframing them as integrated, pronounceable elements within a robust (and reversible) spoken language system.

    </p>


<h4>Without Loss of Generality</h4>

<p>The example MI(OU) HAI SET remains provisional, as both our understanding of the core sound primitives and the full set of primitives required are still evolving. Nevertheless, without loss of generality, the broader principle holds: determinatives can be optionally vocalized for clarification, and multiple determinatives can be strung together when additional specificity is needed. This layered approach to disambiguation remains robust even as individual primitive interpretations continue to be refined.</p>

      Meaning is not symbolic or arbitrary, but emerges from primitive sound–glyph operators acting in sequence,
      within a domain, as a process unfolds. Meaning is something that happens.

      Once a process is understood and repeated, it can be compressed into a stable token, reused without re-deriving
      the full process each time, while still retaining the ability to be decompressed if needed.
