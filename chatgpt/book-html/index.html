    <h3>Why this book exists, who it is for, and how to read it.</h3>
	
	<p>This book began with a simple frustration.</p>

    <p>Egyptian hieroglyphs are often presented as either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a mystical symbolic system filled with gods and metaphors, or</li>
      <li>a technical philological puzzle accessible only through specialized training.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both approaches capture something true — and both miss something essential.</p>

    <p>
      What is often lost is the possibility that Egyptian was neither primarily mythic nor merely symbolic,
      but deliberately designed: a language engineered to describe reality as it was experienced by a
      civilization that depended on water, land, cycles, labor, administration, and continuity.
    </p>

    <p>This book is an attempt to recover that possibility.</p>

    <hr>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="preface-why-written">
    <h3>Why This Book Was Written</h3>

    <p>Most introductions to Egyptian focus on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>how to transliterate glyphs,</li>
      <li>how to memorize sign lists,</li>
      <li>or how to map words into modern languages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Far fewer ask a more fundamental question:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        What kind of language did Egyptian need to be in order to support a civilization like Egypt?
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      A society that engineered irrigation systems, managed seasonal floods, surveyed land, tracked time,
      and administered resources at scale would require a language capable of:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>precision,</li>
      <li>reuse,</li>
      <li>compression,</li>
      <li>and long-term stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The central thesis of this book is that Egyptian met those requirements by functioning as a
      <em>process language</em> — one that describes actions unfolding within domains, rather than merely
      labeling objects or narrating events.
    </p>

  <section class="section" id="preface-who-for">
    <h3>Who This Book Is For</h3>

    <p>This book is written for several audiences at once:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Curious readers with no background in linguistics or Egyptology, who want a clear and intuitive
        explanation of how Egyptian works.
      </li>
      <li>
        Students and scholars of language, history, or cognitive science, who are open to structural models
        that complement traditional approaches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Systems thinkers — programmers, engineers, mathematicians — who recognize patterns of design,
        compression, and operator logic when they see them.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>No prior knowledge of Egyptian is required.<br>
      Technical language is introduced gradually, always anchored to real-world experience.
    </p>

    <hr>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="preface-what-is-not">
    <h3>What This Book Is — and Is Not</h3>

    <p>This book does not attempt to replace:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>established grammatical descriptions,</li>
      <li>philological scholarship,</li>
      <li>or historical reconstruction.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Instead, it offers a complementary framework that explains why many features of Egyptian behave the way
      they do, and why long-standing puzzles persist under purely symbolic interpretations.
    </p>

    <p>The model presented here is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>explicit,</li>
      <li>testable,</li>
      <li>and open to refinement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Where evidence is uncertain, that uncertainty is acknowledged.</p>

    <hr>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="preface-method">
    <h3>A Note on Method</h3>

    <p>Throughout this book, you will see an unusual emphasis on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>sound geometry,</li>
      <li>physical articulation,</li>
      <li>spatial orientation,</li>
      <li>and process diagrams.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is intentional.</p>

    <p>
      The approach taken here treats language not as a list of correspondences, but as a system of operations —
      closer in spirit to mathematics, music, or engineering than to lexicography.
    </p>

    <p>Readers are encouraged not merely to agree or disagree, but to try the model:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>decompose words,</li>
      <li>follow process chains,</li>
      <li>test predictions.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If the model works, it will work repeatedly.<br>
      If it fails, it will fail clearly.
    </p>

  <section class="section" id="preface-how-to-read">
    <h3>How to Read This Book</h3>

    <p>The chapters build sequentially, but not rigidly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Early chapters focus on sound and meaning.</li>
      <li>Middle chapters show how those elements scale into writing, agency, and society.</li>
      <li>Later chapters explore memory, diffusion, and survival.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Interludes and examples are included so that theory never drifts too far from application.
    </p>

    <p>
      You do not need to accept every claim to benefit from the framework.

    <h3>A Final Word Before Beginning</h3>

    <p>Egyptian hieroglyphs have survived for thousands of years.</p>

    <p>
      They deserve to be approached not only with reverence, but with curiosity — and with the willingness to ask
      whether the people who created them knew exactly what they were doing.
    </p>

    <p>This book is written in that spirit.</p>

<section class="section" id="intro-what-is-language">
    <h3>What Is Language?</h3>

    <p>
      Language is a system humans use to represent and share meaning. At its most basic
      level, it connects <strong>sound</strong>, <strong>thought</strong>, and
      <strong>reality</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a practical and mathematical point of view, language can be understood as a
      process of <strong>clustering</strong>:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Individual sounds are the smallest usable units.</li>
      <li>Sounds cluster together to form words.</li>
      <li>Words cluster to form ideas.</li>
      <li>Ideas cluster to form shared meaning about the world.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When spoken, these sound clusters allow humans to vocally convey meaning — to
      describe objects, actions, emotions, relationships, and events. When writing is
      introduced, those same sound clusters are represented using symbols, creating
      written tokens that preserve meaning beyond the moment of speech.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Speech clusters sounds into meaning; writing attempts to capture those sound
          clusters into symbols that preserve meaning.
        </strong>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      This relationship between sound and symbol is not accidental. Writing systems do not
      arise independently of speech; they are engineered extensions of spoken language,
      designed to encode and transmit the same clusters of meaning in a durable visual form.
    </p>

    <hr>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="intro-from-sound-to-symbol">
    <h3>From Sound to Symbol</h3>

    <p>Every writing system must answer a basic question:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>How do we represent spoken meaning in a durable form?</strong></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Different systems answer this question differently. Some choose to represent:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>individual sounds (alphabets),</li>
      <li>syllables,</li>
      <li>whole words,</li>
      <li>or combinations of these strategies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Egyptian hieroglyphs are often described as a mixture of pictures and sounds. While
      this is true at a surface level, it does not fully explain how the system actually
      functions.
    </p>

    <p>In this book, we approach Egyptian writing as a structured mapping:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sound clusters → meaningful units</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Meaningful units → written tokens</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Rather than treating symbols as decorative images or mnemonic aids, we treat them as
      <strong>functional components</strong> in a system deliberately designed to
      represent reality.
    </p>

    <hr>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="intro-engineered-system">
    <h3>Language as an Engineered System</h3>

    <p>Viewed this way, language behaves much like other engineered systems:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Mathematics clusters numbers into equations.</li>
      <li>Music clusters tones into harmony.</li>
      <li>Computer science clusters instructions into programs.</li>
      <li>Language clusters sounds into descriptions of the world.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Egyptian, as we will show, takes this idea further than most languages. Its symbols
      are not merely labels for things, but tools for describing
      <strong>processes</strong> — water flowing, breath moving, land emerging, people
      meeting, emotion becoming visible.
    </p>

    <p>
      This suggests that Egyptian was not simply a pictorial script or an early experiment
      in writing, but a carefully structured language system optimized for
      <strong>clarity, reuse, and compression</strong>.
    </p>

    <hr>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="intro-why-egyptian-special">
    <h3>Why Egyptian Is Special</h3>

    <p>
      The Egyptian writing system developed in a civilization that depended heavily on:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>geometry,</li>
      <li>surveying,</li>
      <li>timekeeping,</li>
      <li>irrigation,</li>
      <li>and long-term record keeping.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It should not surprise us, then, that its language reflects the same engineering
      mindset: precise, technical, and systematic.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the chapters that follow, we will explore how Egyptian encodes meaning using
      sound-based operators, how symbols function as compressed representations of sound
      clusters, and how the language describes reality through
      <strong>ordered processes rather than static labels</strong>.
    </p>

  <section class="section" id="intro-egyptian-engineered">
    <h3>Egyptian as an Engineered Language</h3>

    <p>
      Egyptian, the language of the ancient civilization along the Nile, is often viewed
      primarily through the lens of hieroglyphs — symbols representing things, ideas, or
      sounds. While this description captures part of the truth, it obscures a deeper
      organizing principle.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this book, we propose an alternative view:
      <strong>Egyptian was a process-based language</strong> — a carefully engineered
      system of symbols used to represent actions, movements, and events, not just
      objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hieroglyphs were not random pictures or loose abstractions. They functioned as
      <strong>operators</strong>: each symbol served a specific role within a larger
      linguistic system.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Words in Egyptian describe processes — things happening in the world, physically
          and emotionally.
        </strong>
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Meaning emerges from how symbols are ordered and combined.
    </p>

    <hr>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="intro-epom-escm">
    <h3>EPOM–ESCM: The Core Framework</h3>

    <p>
      To describe this structure precisely, this book introduces a formal framework:
    </p>

    <p><strong>EPOM–ESCM</strong></p>

    <p>Uncompressed, this stands for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Emergent · Process-based · Operational · Meaning (EPOM)</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Engineered · Semantic · Compression · Model (ESCM)</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Together, these describe how meaning is generated through operators acting on
      processes, and how those meanings are compressed, ordered, and nested within sound
      clusters and symbols.
    </p>

    <p>
      The acronym itself demonstrates the principle it names: without decompression rules,
      compressed forms become opaque.
    </p>
	
	
	<p><strong>EPOM</strong><br>
      <em>Emergent · Process-based · Operational · Meaning</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Meaning is not symbolic or arbitrary, but emerges from primitive sound–glyph operators acting in sequence,
      within a domain, as a process unfolds. Meaning is something that happens.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>ESCM</strong><br>
      <em>Engineered · Semantic · Compression · Model</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once a process is understood and repeated, it can be compressed into a stable token, reused without re-deriving
      the full process each time, while still retaining the ability to be decompressed if needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      This explains determinatives, logograms, and n-grams as lossless semantic compression—not silent decorations.
    </p>

  <section class="section" id="intro-closing-thought">
    <h3>Closing Thought</h3>

    <p>
      Egyptian was not a primitive language struggling toward abstraction. It was a mature
      system deliberately designed to describe how reality works.
    </p>

    <p>
      The task of this book is not to invent meaning, but to recover the rules that made
      meaning possible.

    <h3>Before Symbols: Breath and Sound</h3>

    <p>All spoken language begins with breath.</p>

    <p>
      Before there are letters, symbols, or writing systems, there is
      <strong>breath</strong>. Air moves through the lungs, rises through the throat,
      and is shaped by the tongue, teeth, lips, and mouth. Sound is not abstract—it is
      <strong>physical</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Egyptian is no exception to this biological reality. What distinguishes Egyptian is not that it uses sound,
      but that it <strong>systematically organizes sound into a coherent, reusable model of reality</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="from-breath-to-sound">
    <h3>From Breath to Sound</h3>

    <p>Human sound production is governed by three primary physical factors:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Airflow</strong> — how air moves (continuous, interrupted, forced, relaxed)</li>
      <li><strong>Constriction</strong> — where airflow is shaped (lips, teeth, tongue, throat)</li>
      <li><strong>Resonance</strong> — how the mouth cavity amplifies or modifies sound</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      These constraints are universal. All human languages draw from the same anatomical apparatus.
      Differences between languages arise not from biology, but from <strong>selection, emphasis, and clustering</strong> of available sounds.
    </p>

    <p>
      This explains why languages across the world share many phonemes, and why certain sounds appear with much higher frequency than others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every human language begins with this same biological reality. The Egyptian language is no exception.
      What makes Egyptian distinctive is not that it used sounds, but that it
      <strong>systematically organized those sounds into a coherent model of reality</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="sound-inventories">
    <h3>Sound Inventories</h3>

    <p>
      Modern linguistics has spent considerable effort cataloging the sounds used by the world's languages.
      One important resource is PHOIBLE, a database that aggregates phoneme inventories from hundreds of languages
      and tracks the frequency of individual sounds across them.
    </p>

    <p>The results are striking:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A relatively small set of sounds appears in the majority of languages.</li>
      <li>These sounds tend to be physically easy to produce.</li>
      <li>More complex sounds are rarer and often culturally constrained.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This empirical observation supports a key idea of this book: Sound systems are shaped by efficiency, not randomness.
      Languages tend to converge on sounds that are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>easy to articulate,</li>
      <li>perceptually distinct,</li>
      <li>and flexible enough to combine into many clusters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>PHOIBLE and the Top Sounds Across World Languages</h3>

    <p>
      In our exploration of sounds, we must acknowledge the work of modern linguistics, which has made great strides
      in cataloging the phonetic inventory of the world's languages. One of the most valuable resources for this task is
      PHOIBLE — a database that aggregates the phonemes (distinctive sound units) used by different languages.
    </p>

    <p>
      PHOIBLE categorizes and ranks these sounds by their frequency across languages, allowing linguists to analyze
      which sounds are universally used, which are rare, and how languages vary in their selection of sounds.
    </p>

    <h4>What is PHOIBLE?</h4>

    <p>
      PHOIBLE (The Phonological Inventory of the World's Languages) is an open-access database that compiles the phoneme
      inventories of over 2,000 languages. It serves as an invaluable tool for comparative phonology and typological studies.
    </p>

    <p>
      By examining PHOIBLE, linguists can investigate sound distributions and identify patterns, such as which sounds appear across
      many languages and which are restricted to specific language families or regions. The database also includes data on the
      frequency of sounds, helping us understand which phonemes are more likely to appear in any given language and which are rarer.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the context of the Egyptian model, PHOIBLE's data provides an important point of reference. It allows us to compare the sound
      system used in Egyptian hieroglyphs with those used in modern languages, grounding our analysis in empirical data rather than
      theoretical assumptions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="the-top-sounds-across-world-languages">
    <h3>The Top Sounds Across World Languages</h3>

    <p>
      Based on PHOIBLE's comprehensive data, here are the most common phonemes across the world's languages. These are sounds that
      appear frequently and consistently across a wide variety of linguistic families.

    <h3>Understanding the PHOIBLE Table</h3>

    <p>Each row in the table represents a phoneme — a unique sound in human language.</p>

    <p>Phonemes can be broken into three key categories:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Plosives</strong> (e.g., /p/, /t/, /k/) — produced by blocking and then releasing airflow.</li>
      <li><strong>Fricatives</strong> (e.g., /f/, /s/, /ʃ/) — produced by narrowing the airflow, creating a turbulent sound.</li>
      <li><strong>Nasals</strong> (e.g., /m/, /n/) — produced by allowing air to pass through the nose.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This table reflects the most common phonemes across a broad sample of languages. We use these sound patterns in our model to
      anchor the Egyptian sound system to modern phonological research.
    </p>

    <p>
      By understanding these fundamental sound-building blocks, we gain insight into how Egyptian may have used similar, naturally occurring
      sounds to form words that describe reality in a structured, process-oriented way.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="toward-a-unified-sound-framework">
    <h3>Toward a Unified Sound Framework</h3>

    <p>The purpose of this chapter is to reorganize sound space in a way that highlights:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>physical production,</li>
      <li>clustering behavior,</li>
      <li>suitability for a unified, process-based language model.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      To accomplish this, we introduce a <strong>sound wheel</strong> — a geometric representation of sound relationships based on airflow,
      mouth shape, effort, and spatial orientation. While the International Phonetic Alphabet catalogs sounds categorically, the sound wheel
      emphasizes <strong>continuity, direction, and geometric proximity</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This prepares the ground for semantic meaning in later chapters. In this chapter, we focus on <strong>how sounds are formed</strong>,
      how they cluster, and how Egyptian appears to have deliberately anchored sound to <strong>geometry, direction, and domain</strong>.

    <h3>Vowels as Domains of Experience</h3>

    <p>
      Vowels exist in every spoken language. They are the most natural sounds humans produce, requiring minimal obstruction of airflow.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this model, vowels function as <strong>domains</strong>. They describe <em>where</em> an action occurs or <em>what kind of experiential space</em>
      it inhabits.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than treating vowels as arbitrary phonetic elements, we treat them as <strong>foundational coordinates in conceptual space</strong>.

  <section class="section" id="a-ascending-toward-coherence">
    <h3>A: Ascending toward coherence</h3>
    <p>
      A is the primary vowel of ascent, order, and elevation in the Egyptian sound model. At the level of meaning, A does not merely indicate “up”
      in a physical sense; it encodes the act of ascending toward coherence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the vowel of organization, alignment, and directed improvement. When A appears in a word, it signals that a process is moving toward
      structure rather than away from it, toward harmony rather than dispersion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spatially, A occupies a privileged position on the vowel wheel. It is placed 22 degrees to the left of true vertical, slightly inward rather
      than directly above the center. This placement is deliberate and meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The significance of A as a marker of divine perfection lies in its role as the ordering counter-force within the system. Where U permits
      disorder and entropy, A compels alignment and meaning.

  <hr>

  <section class="section" id="i-flowing-forward-almost-theoretically">
    <h3>I: Flowing forward almost theoretically</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>I</strong> is the vowel of <strong>water, flow, and life-sustaining movement</strong>, but its meaning is inseparable from its
      <strong>upward orientation</strong>, which in this model represents the <strong>ethereal or ideal dimension</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spatially, I occupies an <strong>outward and upward</strong> position on the vowel wheel. The outward direction places it in the temporal and
      external world; the upward direction lifts it toward the ethereal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deeper significance of I lies in its role as a <strong>bridge between the material and the ideal</strong>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <hr>

  <section class="section" id="u-chaos-of-an-entropic-world">
    <h3>U: Chaos of an entropic world</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>U</strong> is the vowel of <strong>divergence, dispersion, and uncontrolled emergence</strong>.
      It encodes reality as it is encountered in practice: uneven terrain, unpredictable forces, and raw conditions that resist organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spatially, U is positioned <strong>outward and downward</strong> on the vowel wheel—firmly external and grounded in the material.
    </p>
    <p>
      U is the <strong>entropy-permitting element</strong> of the language: it names the external conditions against which order and meaning must continually assert themselves.

  <section class="section" id="o-profoundness-and-intensity-of-a-domain">
    <h3>O: Profoundness and Intensity of a Domain</h3>
    <p>
      O is the vowel of depth, profoundness, and internal intensity, uniquely characterized by its objectivity within the Egyptian sound model.
      It represents the measured profundity of a domain without implying value, aspiration, or disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spatially, O is positioned inward and downward on the vowel wheel. This geometry reinforces O's neutrality: it points toward what lies beneath the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      O is the vowel of objective depth—the sound that names profundity without emotion, direction, or intent.

  <section class="section" id="the-glottal-stop-ʔ-the-null-operator">
    <h3>The Glottal Stop (ʔ): The NULL Operator</h3>

    <p>
      The <strong>glottal stop</strong> (ʔ) is the <strong>stoppage of airflow</strong> at the vocal cords. Whether or not it is formally specified
      in a linguistic culture, it is a functional reality of the vocalization system.
    </p>

    <p>For English speakers, this sound can be difficult to notice, but it is common in speech. Say the phrase:</p>

    <blockquote class="book-quote">
      <p><strong>“Uh-oh”</strong></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      The pause between the two syllables is the glottal stop. Focus on the moment where airflow is completely halted—that is <strong>ʔ</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this model, the glottal stop represents: absence, boundary, intentional stopping, the <strong>NULL</strong> state (not zero, but <em>lack</em>).
      It is essential for describing limits, breaks, control, and restraint.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The glottal stop (ʔ)</strong> is the vowel of <strong>intentional stoppage</strong>, physically defined by the complete arrest of airflow at the
      vocal cords. The same closure is used when humans <strong>swallow food or water</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the Egyptian sound model, the glottal stop represents the <strong>NULL operator</strong>. NULL is not zero; it is the <strong>absence of quantity</strong>.
      ʔ marks boundaries, interruptions, and limits—places where a process is halted so that something else may safely occur.

    <h3>E: The central monad</h3>

      <p><strong>Figure 2.5</strong> — <em>Monad E as Central Stabilizing Vowel</em></p>
      <p class="small text-muted"><em>(Sound wheel showing E at the center, slightly elevated, stabilizing A and U.)</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Beyond the five primal vowels is <strong>E</strong>, called the <strong>Monad E</strong>. E is not a resting vowel. It requires muscular tension,
      precise tongue positioning, and continuous effort to sustain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of this, <strong>E is not a primal vowel</strong>. Instead, E functions as a stabilizing center—a reference point, the origin of the vowel wheel.
      E sits at the center, slightly elevated, reflecting that it is constructed, effortful, and temporary.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>E</strong> is the vowel of <strong>centering, reference, and stabilization</strong>. Unlike the primal vowels, E does not describe a natural domain of
      experience; it describes the <strong>act of imposing balance</strong>.

    <h3>The Stressed Vowel: Æ</h3>

    <p class="text-muted">[insert sound wheel showing 5 vowels here adding the monad and stressed vowel]</p>

    <p>
      Æ is a <strong>distressed extension of E</strong>. Physiologically, the mouth opens wider, the sound is strained, and it resembles a cry of alarm or distress.
    </p>

    <p>
      Æ is not common and is used only in urgent, emotional, or extreme contexts. It marks <strong>overextension of stabilization</strong>—when centering itself becomes strained.
    </p>

    <p>
      Æ is the vowel of distress, strain, and alarmed extension. It represents the moment when control is still attempted but no longer sustainable.

    <h3>Vowel Space and Blends</h3>

    <p>
      The five primal vowels plus <strong>E</strong> cover most of the vowel space used in human languages.
      Their pronunciation is most accurately approximated in modern Spanish.
    </p>

    <p>Additional vowel sounds arise through <strong>blending</strong>.</p>

    <section class="subsection" id="blends-as-lazy-loading">
      <h4>Blends as Lazy Loading</h4>

      <p>
        Human speech tends toward efficiency. Over time, vowels “pull” toward one another.
        These are <strong>lazy-loaded blends</strong>, not new primitives.
      </p>

      <p>In this model:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>blends are written in parentheses,</li>
        <li>the <strong>first vowel is primary</strong>,</li>
        <li>the second vowel represents the <strong>direction of pull</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>(EI)</strong> → E pulled toward I (as in <em>say</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>(IE)</strong> → I pulled toward E (as one potential variant of <em>milk</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>(Aʔ)</strong> → A pulled toward the glottal stop ʔ (as in <em>son</em>)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Importantly: <strong>UA</strong> is two unblended vowels. <strong>(UA)</strong> is a blended vowel with U as primary, pulled toward A.
      </p>

      <p class="text-muted">[insert sound wheel + blend figures here]</p>

      <p>Blends add <strong>nuance</strong>, not new domains.</p>

    <h3>Consonants as Operators</h3>

    <p>If vowels describe <strong>domains</strong>, consonants describe <strong>actions</strong>.</p>

    <p>
      Egyptian uses <strong>22 core consonants</strong>, which can be grouped conceptually into clusters.
      These clusters reflect <strong>how air is shaped</strong>, <strong>how motion occurs</strong>, and <strong>how processes unfold</strong>.

    <h3>Breath and Modulation Cluster</h3>

    <p>
      Egyptian writing was developed in a civilization deeply concerned with breath, water, land, motion, and continuity.
      It is therefore unsurprising that its sound system reflects airflow patterns, mouth geometry, and clustered efficiency.
    </p>

    <section class="subsection" id="h-breath">
      <h4>H — Breath</h4>
      <p>H represents breath itself: inhalation, exhalation, life force in motion.</p>
      <p>It is foundational. All other sounds ride on breath.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>H</strong> is the consonant of <strong>breath, airflow, and vitality</strong>. When H appears in a word, it signals that a process is animated by breath:
        alive, circulating, and sustained.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="subsection" id="m-turning">
      <h4>M — Turning</h4>
      <p>M represents the turning or modulation of breath: internal circulation, reversal, oscillation.</p>

      <p>
        M is the consonant of turning, modulation, and internal circulation. It describes processes that cycle, reverse, fold back, or circulate internally.

    <h3>Midline of Mouth: (th) sound as Eastern Marker</h3>
    <p>
      Its position is nearly perfectly east to represent a profile view of the human mouth with this midpoint sound (th)
      defining the easternmost quadrant representing the most external formulation. Similarly, the glottal stop represents
      the westernmost quadrant representing the most internal formulation.
    </p>
    <p>To the left, we internalize sound. To the right we externalize sound.</p>

  <section class="section" id="midline-of-top-of-mouth-l-sound-as-northern-marker">
    <h3>Midline of Top of Mouth: “L” sound as Northern Marker</h3>
    <p>
      Say the English word <em>leaf</em> (annotated here as LIF). Notice how L is formed with the tongue touching the roof of the mouth.
      This is the midline between the internal and external.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrast the beauty of an operatic A to a baby crying with a distressed Æ sound. A is elevating while internalizing; Æ elevates while externalizing.

  <section class="section" id="sound-string-examples">
    <h3>Sound string examples</h3>
    <p>
      In any language, you can map a sound string to the sound wheel. Meaning of sound is not fully described yet; however,
      spatial geometry can already be informative and insightful.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="hua">
    <h3>HUA</h3>
    <p>
      This string of sounds is not a word precisely in English but may be related to the verbal affirmation “Hooah.”
      “H” is the source of breath, which can naturally descend along the “U” track and return toward “A.”
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="den-vs-dan">
    <h3>Den vs. Dan</h3>
    <p>
      Say the word “den” (DEN) and notice where the three sound formations occur. Contrast this with “Dan” (DÆN).
      Look in the mirror and compare how much more your mouth opens to make the distressed vowel Æ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now try “need” (NID). Notice again how the order of sounds is a unique geometry signature.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="jokes">
    <h3>Jokes</h3>
    <p>
      We could classify this word as JOKS or JOKZ. The distinction in geometry is the signature differences between “S” and “Z.”
      Later, when sound meanings are developed, this geometry becomes even more interesting.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="milk">
    <h3>Milk</h3>
    <p>
      The word “milk” is a good example. Breath comes from “H” and naturally flows toward “U.” On its way out, the lips form “M”
      and then we move toward “I,” but laziness develops so we do not run out of air. This is why the vowel may be represented as (IE) or (Iʔ).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="summary">
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Sounds are not random. They arise from breath, shape, effort, and geometry.</p>

    <p>Egyptian organizes sounds into:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>vowels as domains,</li>
      <li>consonants as operators,</li>
      <li>blends as nuance,</li>
      <li>geometry as structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In the next chapter, we move from <strong>sound formation</strong> to <strong>sound meaning</strong>,
      showing how these primitives combine to describe reality with precision.
