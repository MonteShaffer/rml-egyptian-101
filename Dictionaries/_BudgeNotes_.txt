Benefits:  Budge was the bridge between original scholarship and academic curation of research.  That is, his efforts were based on the cutting-edge thinking of the day.  Rather that reduce readability, Budge attempted to enhance it by guessing at the vowels largely based on existing pronunciations of existing words in the Coptic language of his time.

Pronunciation estimations where the "e" may be more like an "o" but it represents a consisten best guess.  An effort to understand how to pronounce words with many replicates, such as one more with four "n" sounds.  The missing "l" sound (is it "r" for lion?).  Why the Erman system was mostly avoided.  

This work represents an effort to bring mathematical "axiomatic" logic to the study of the language which I estimate to be a wise approach.  Concept of 1-to-1 mapping.  Distinctions are not fully collapsed, let the original data speak with limited academic assumptions.
