Egyptian 101

Understanding the hieroglyphic language of Ancient Egypt.

The language was very mathematical in nature.  It has been called the Adamic language or the language of the Gods.  

The language can be understood like a tower of Jenga blocks.  Once built, it was beautiful.  Yet a bit boring for the children, so they crashed the Jenga tower.  However, the robustness of the language allows for such chaos.  From the broken forms, the children were able to create new a beautiful languages.  And literature.  And philosophies.  All by intelligent design.

Yet, the remnants of the evolution of subset languages allow for the primary language to be restored.  If one applies basic principles of mathematics.

Consider for example the word 'mathematics': this is one anchor word that can be used to reconstruct the ancient language.

- In English:  "mathematics"
- In Spanish: "matem√°tica"
- In Champollion Egyptian: "maati maati kham" (the virtue and truth of number; likely not additive {summation} but rather multiplicative in a simple {product} or compound {cross product} form)
- TRUE Egyptian, the Adamic language: ??? [Proceed dear reader, and you will discuss this for yourself!]

ENJOY THE RIDE!
